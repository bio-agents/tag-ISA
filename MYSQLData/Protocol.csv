"Extraction","For the human studies, midstream urine (∼15 ml) samples were collected and frozen from each volunteer. In total, 84 samples were collected from 12 healthy volunteers (7 time points, 8 males and 4 females) and 50 samples from 30 T2DM patients (1–3 time points, 17 males and 13 females) with well-controlled blood glucose maintained at normal concentrations by diet, following the guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association, rather than medication. The healthy subjects were aged 18–55 yr, had a body mass index (BMI) ≥19 and ≤30 kg/m2 and a body mass ≥50 kg and ≤113 kg, and were free from any major disease or pregnancy. The T2DM patients were aged 30–65 yr (mean 56 ± 9 yr), had a BMI >25 and <40 kg/m2, weighed between 65 and 140 kg (mean 95 ± 19 kg), and were taking at most one oral anti-diabetic drug.

"Mass spectrometry","Eluted compounds were detected by a micrOTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization source in positive and negative ion mode. Typical instrument settings were as follows: capillary voltage 4500 V, capillary exit 130 V, dry gas temperature 200 °C, dry gas flow of 8 l/min. Ions were detected from m/z 200 to 1400 at a scan rate of 1 Hz. Mass calibration was performed using sodium formate clusters (10 mM solution of NaOH in 50/50 % v/v isopropanol/water containing 0.2 % formic acid).","MTBLS10"
"Data transformation","Raw data were exported as netCDF files and processed with the m/z feature detection and retention time alignment BioConductor package xcms (v1.30, http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.9/bioc/html/xcms.html), using following parameters for feature detection: method = centWave, ppm = 20, snthresh = 10, peakwidth = (20,50). For alignment, we repeated the xcms group method twice and performed a retention time correction in between with the following parameters: minfrac = 0.5, bw1 = 60, bw2 = 25, mzwid1 = 0.05, mzwid2 = 0.02, span = 1, extra = 0, missing = 0. Areas of missing features were estimated using the fillPeaks method. Annotation of compound spectra and corresponding ion species was performed with the BioConductor package CAMERA (v1.9.8, http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.9/bioc/html/CAMERA.html). Compound spectra were built with CAMERA according to the retention time similarity, the presence of detected isotopic patterns and to the strength of the correlation values among extracted ion currents (EICs) of co-eluting m/z features. CAMERA grouping and correlation methods were used with default parameters except the threshold for EIC correlation (cor_eic_th) which was increased to 0.85. Clustered features were annotated based on the match (+/- 5 ppm) of calculated m/z differences versus an ion species and neutral loss transitions rule set. Mass differences corresponding to NH3CH2, NH3CH3H2 and NH3C2H4 neutral losses were added to the default rule set of CAMERA. If one or more mass differences can be assigned to a compound spectrum, CAMERA will also deduce the neutral exact mass [M] of the underlying compound.","MTBLS10"
"Metabolite identification","A MetFrag query file was created for every CAMERA-deduced molecular mass hypothesis [M] if the associated compound spectrum contained at least one fragment peak, i.e. a m/z feature with a lower m/z value than [M]. Annotated isotopic peaks and multiply-charged ions such as [M+2H]2+ were excluded. These MS1.5 compound spectra usually contain a subset of the information that can be expected in a full tandem mass spectrum, but may also include false positives, i.e. unrelated features. Compounds within the injection peak were not considered.","MTBLS10"

"NMR assay","Two 1H NMR experiments optimized by Bruker (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA) for metabonomics studies were run on all samples: a standard 1D pulse and acquire pulse sequence employing water-suppression using pre-saturation (zgpr) and the one-dimensional first increment of a nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment with pre-saturation (noesygppr1d). All experiments included on-resonance water pre-saturation achieved by irradiation during a 4.0 s recycle delay. The 90° pulse width was determined for every sample using the automatic pulse calculation feature in TopSpin 3.1. All pulse widths were 8.5 ± 0.5 μs. The zgpr experiment was used to screen samples and ensure that pre-saturation and shimming were sufficient to collect reliable data. Shimming quality was determined by measuring the full width at half height (FWHH) of the Trimethylsilyl propionate (TSP) peak, which was deemed acceptable when the FWHH < 1.0 Hz. One-dimensional zgpr 1H spectra were acquired using 8 scans and 2 dummy scans, with 45K points per spectrum. This resulted in an acquisition time of 1.92 s. Once the spectrum was determined to be of acceptable quality the 1D NOESY experiment was collected. The one-dimensional first increment of the NOESY experiment was collected using 128 scans with 4 dummy scans. 65K points per spectrum were collected which resulted in an acquisition time of 3.21 s.

Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection.

"Metabolite identification","A complete matrix of peak heights representing arbitrary mass spectral ion currents of all available mass features was used for initial numerical analysis. Peak heights were corrected by the amount of cells using OD750 and to the recovered amount of the internal standard, ribitol, to yield normalized responses. These normalized responses were used to calculate response ratios, subsequently also called relative content, compared to the respective choice of control condition. Identification of metabolite-specific mass fragments from this data matrix was manually supervised. Compounds were identified using the TargetFinder plug-in of TagFinder-Software and a reference library of mass spectra and retention indices from the collection of the Golm Metabolome Database (http://csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/csbdb/gmd/home/gmd_sm.html; [1]).

"Sample collection","Six different spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines were used in the experiments. Treated ears were sampled either directly after treatment (time point 0) or 12, 24, 48 and 96 hours after treatment. The ear was cut from the plant and the non-treated spikelets were removed by clipping the rachis with a surgical scissor below and above the treated spikelets. The treated ear part including the rachis and complete spikelets (chaff and florets) was put in a small vial. Harvested samples were immediately quenched in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at -80°C until further processing. Each of the frozen wheat samples were milled to a fine powder for 2 min at 30 Hz using a ball mill (MM301 Retsch, Germany) with liquid nitrogen pre-cooled 10 mL stainless steel vessels and a 9-mm stainless steel ball.","MTBLS112"
"Extraction","The homogenized wheat ears (100±2 mg fresh weight) were weighed into Eppendorf tubes and extracted with 1 mL of pre-cooled methanol/water 3+1 (v/v) including 0.1% formic acid, by vortexing for 10 seconds and further treatment in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 8,500 × g at 4°C and 200 µL of the supernatant were combined with 140 µL water, 75 µL chloroform and 10 µL of internal standard mixture. After shaking, the tubes were again centrifuged for 4 min at 8,500 × g at 4°C and 200 µL of the methanol/water phase were transferred into micro-inserts in GC/HPLC vials. The samples were evaporated overnight using a centrifugal evaporator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO) at 15°C and subsequently put on the GC auto sampler (PAL LHX-xt, CTC Analytics, Carrboro, NC) for an optimized online two step derivatization procedure. The sample was re-suspended in 40 µL MOX (20 mg/mL pyridine) and agitated for 90 min at 60°C. Thereafter, 50 µL MSTFA and 10 µL internal standard (NONA, 370 mg/L) were added before the vial was again agitated at 60°C for 60 min. Prior to analysis, the samples were kept in the drawer for 10 min at 4°C to allow equilibration and sedimentation of particles. ","MTBLS112"
"Chromatography","For separation and detection of analytes an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled to a 5975C inert XL MSD detector (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) was used. The instruments were controlled by ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies, version E.02.01.1177). A volume of 1 µL of the liquid sample was injected into the split/splitless injector at 250°C in split mode and using a split of 25:1. An HP5-ms column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) was operated at a constant flow of 1 mL/min helium. After keeping the oven at 50°C for 2 min, it was heated to 310°C (10°C/min) and subsequently kept at this temperature for 15 min.","MTBLS112"
"Mass spectrometry","Compounds were detected from m/z 50-800 utilizing the 5975C inert XL MSD detector (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The MSD interface was kept at 290°C throughout the run. After 7 minutes of solvent delay, the detector was used in scan mode The EI source was kept at 230°C and the MSD quadrupole at 150°C. Autotuning of the MSD was performed at least once a week or after exchange of spare parts.","MTBLS112"
"Data transformation","Raw GC-MS data files were acquired by ChemStation and exported in the net.cdf format. The converted files were subsequently imported by the MetaboliteDetector software (version 2.5.20130104-Linux) and further processed. Besides mass spectral deconvolution (settings: peak threshold 5; minimum peak height 5; deconvolution width 7; required number of peaks 20) and computation of feature areas for relative quantification, the retention index for compound recognition was calculated and the corresponding spectra were compared to an in-house library.","MTBLS112"
"Metabolite identification","Retention indices and GC-MS spectra were compared to an in-house library. This library was established by measuring 132 authentic reference standards using the same derivatization protocol, analytical parameters and instrument as the wheat samples analysed in this study. Metabolites were identified by comparison of mass spectra and retention indices to the spectra library using a cut-off value of 70%. The feature areas of three specific fragment ions were recorded for each metabolite and the ion with the highest signal to noise ratio was detected by an in-house, Python based software, and chosen for further data processing and comparative quantification in all samples.","MTBLS112"
"Sample collection","In this study, Euglena gracilis wild-type Z strain and a streptomycin-bleached mutant SM-ZK with less chloroplasts (Mccalla, 1963; Oda et al., 1982) were used. They were maintained in 150 mL of Koren-Hutner medium (pH 5.0) in Sakaguchi flasks at 27°C under continuous light on a shaker (120 rpm) for 2 days (early-log phase) or 4 days (late-log phase) (Koren and Hunter, 1967). Wax ester fermentation was induced either by halting the culture agitation, which stops aeration and induces hypoxia, or by aerating N2 gas into culture medium for 10 min to remove oxygen and other gases, including carbon dioxide, completely. For anoxic conditions induced by N2 gas aeration, different NaHCO3 concentration (1 mM and 10 mM) were added to investigate the effect of a carbon source on wax fermentation. Cells were collected 0, 4, and 24 h after the initiation of anaerobiosis and were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen followed by lyophilization.","MTBLS113"
"Extraction","The method for the extraction of lipophilic compounds was modified from Furuhashi and Weckwerth (2013). Approximately 5 mg of lyophilized Euglena sample was homogenized with quartz sands (Wako, Osaka, Japan) (approximately 300 mg) in 1 mL of MCA solvent (methanol/chloroform/2 % acetic acid, 5:2:1, v/v/v) using a Mixer Mill MM400 (Retsch, Haan, Germany) for 90 s at 30 Hz. For absolute quantification, 60 µg C20:0 FAME (Larodan, Sweden) was added into 1 mL MCA solvent before homogenizing. The sample was centrifuged at 21,000 × ɡ for 3 min. The supernatant was divided into two fractions, retaining 200 µL for wax ester analysis and the remaining 800 µL for total lipophilic compound analysis. Phase separation was conducted by adding 500 µL of water and 400 µL of chloroform to the supernatant. The sample was centrifuged at 21,000 × ɡ for 3 min, and an upper polar phase was removed. The remaining inter-phase and the bottom apolar phase were desiccated using a centrifugal evaporator (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, MA, USA). ","MTBLS113"
"Chromatography","GC-MS measurements were carried out on a gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS) (Auto sampler, JASCO PAL GC-xt; GC, Agilent 6890N; MS, Waters GTC premier) instrument (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The injector temperature was 230°C using a cold trap splitless mode. The flow rate of carrier He gas was 1 ml/min-1. GC separation was performed on an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). After a 1-min isothermal period at 70°C, the temperature was programmed to 76°C at a heating rate of 1°C min-1, then to 350°C at a heating rate of 6°C min-1 and maintained for 1 min. The temperatures of the GC-MS transfer line and the source of the mass spectrometer were 340°C and 250°C, respectively. ","MTBLS113"

"Metabolite identification","Metabolites were identified based on their mass spectral characteristics and retention times by comparison with retention times of reference compounds in an in-house reference library. All metabolites were quantified using QuanLynx (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), a software for the analysis of mass spectrometric data.","MTBLS113"
"Derivatization","For wax esters and other free form lipophilic compound profiling, the dried apolar (with inter-phase) pellet was incubated with 20 µL methoxamine-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (40 mg/mL pyridine) for 90 min at 30°C. N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifuoroacetamide (80 µL; MSTFA: Sigma-Aldrich) for silylation was added and incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and 1 µL of the sample was injected into the GC-MS. 2.4 Methyl esterification and derivatization for total lipophilic compound profilingAlkaline methyl esterification converted only the bounded form of fatty acids (e.g., glycerides and wax esters) into FAMEs. The resulting glycerol and fatty alcohols (FALs) with free fatty acids (FFAs) and steroids contained in the original sample were silylated during the subsequent MSTFA treatment (Furuhashi and Weckwerth, 2013).","MTBLS113"

"NMR sample","Blood serum was centrifuged and the supernatant (200 ?L) was mixed with D2O (400 ?L). The samples were analyzed at 25 �C.","MTBLS114"
"NMR spectroscopy","The samples were analyzed on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer using a 5-mm 1H/13C/15N/31P QNP probe. The water suppressed spin-echo Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence (relaxation delay-90-(t-180-t)n-acquire) was used to allow attenuation of broad signals from macromolecules, with a total CPMG time of 105 ms (n = 128). Spectra were recorded using 512 transients with 32k data points and a spectral width of 6410 Hz. Water suppression was achieved by irradiation during the relaxation delay of 3 s.","MTBLS114"
"NMR assay","All spectra were processed with Topspin 2.0 (Bruker). A zero-filling factor of 2 and a line-broadening of 0.5 Hz were applied to the spectra. Phasing was done automatically, followed by manual phasing if necessary, and baseline correction was automatically performed by subtraction of a polynomial of fifth degree. The signal of the anomeric proton of ?-glucose was used as a reference (? 5.233 ppm).","MTBLS114"
"Data transformation","","MTBLS114"
"Metabolite identification","Spectral signals were assigned by comparison of chemical shifts with values from the literature and from the Chenomx library (Chenomx NMR Suite 7.5, Chenomx Inc., Alberta, US). In order to support the assignment of metabolite signals, DOSY, 1H,1H-TOCSY and 1H,13C-HSQC experiments were run on selected samples, which were then spiked with some of the expected metabolites.","MTBLS114"
"Sample collection","Reef-building coral samples were collected from a small area (ca. 135 m2) of a fringing reef in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii (21°25'58.28""N, 157°47'23.55""W) using bone cutters and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen. Samples used to assess intra-colony and technical variation in metabolite profiles were collected in December 2011, while those used to assess inter-colony variability were sampled in June 2013. While coral metabolite content may change, variability measured in 1H-NMR profiles is still likely to be comparable within and among colonies through time. Following sample collection, coral fragments were lyophilized and stored at -80 °C prior to metabolite extraction. To assess technical variation, three replicate fragments from separate colonies were collected, pooled, and pulverized. From these samples, 5 replicate extractions were performed. Five fragments of a single Porites compressa colony, which is a dominant reef-building coral in Hawaii, and 5 from separate colonies were used to assess intra- and inter-colony variation in 1H-NMR profiles.","MTBLS116"
"Extraction","All Porites compressa samples were extracted following extraction method 1. Only inter-colony samples were re-extracted using method 2 to determine if variation in metabolite profiles differed between protocols used in the current study.Extraction Method 1.  1 ml of pre-cooled 70% methanol/water (v/v; 70% MeOH) was added for every 0.7 g of coral to assess technical, intra-, and inter-colony variability. All extracts were sonicated for 15 min and shaken for 24 h at 4 °C. To ensure samples were fully extracted, a second solvent volume was added to each coral fragment for an additional 24 h at 4 °C. The two resulting extracts were combined and cellular debris removed by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant containing the extracted metabolites was removed from the pellet and concentrated using a speed-vacuum concentrator. Extract weights were obtained prior to data acquisition and used to normalize 1H-NMR spectra.Extraction method 2.  Five inter-colony samples were also extracted by adding 2 mL of 70% MeOH (v/v) for every 0.1 g of coral. Extracts were sonicated for 15 min, mixed on ice for 45 min, and concentrated using a combination of rotary evaporation and lyophilization. Extract weights were obtained prior to data acquisition and used to normalize between 1H-NMR spectra.Spiking Experiment.   Eighteen fragments from a P. compressa colony were collected from a small region (c.a. 135 m2) of a fringing reef adjacent to HIMB in December 2011. Fragment volumes were assessed by displacement of deionized (DI) water, which was used to remove excess salt and to determine the amount of solvent to add to each nubbin during metabolite extraction. While the addition of DI water may activate enzymatic pathways resulting in changes in metabolite composition, the identical treatment across all samples allows for comparison of coral metabolomes. Subsequently, fragments were immersed in liquid nitrogen to halt metabolism. To evaluate the capacity of 1H-NMR methods to identify differences in concentrations of coral metabolites, 1 M alanine, 1 M glycolic acid, and 1 M glucose were combined and diluted with DI water to prepare 0.1 mM and 10 mM metabolite cocktail spikes. Directly prior to metabolite extraction, 10 µL of the treatment and control (DI water only) cocktails were added to the surface of each whole coral nubbin (n = 6/treatment). Five mL of 70% methanol was added to each fragment for every 1 mL of coral volume (v/v) and metabolites were extracted following method 2 described above.Species Comparison.  Replicate fragments (n = 8–9) of Montipora aequituberculata, Pocillopora damicornis, Porites lobata, and Seriatopora hystrix were collected from Nanwan Bay, Taiwan (ca. 21°56'31""N, 120°44'56""E) in the June of 2011 and transported to the National Museum for Marine Biology and Aquarium (NMMBA), Checheng, Taiwan. These coral species are dominant reef-building corals in Taiwan and represent ecologically distinct taxa with varying morphological and physiological characteristics. Corals were re-fragmented and allowed to recover in a flow-through holding tank (environmental conditions: Temperature 27.6±0.03 °C; Salinity 33.8±0.02 ppt; Light 107±3.85 µmol photon) for two weeks prior to sampling for metabolome analysis. Corals were briefly rinsed with DI water to remove excess salts, immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, pulverized and transported on dry ice back to the HIMB where they were stored at -80 °C. Metabolites were extracted following extraction method 2 described above.","MTBLS116"
"NMR sample","Coral extracts were reconstituted in 250 µl of deuterium oxide (D2O) containing 1 mM of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid sodium salt (TMSP-d4) to facilitate comparison of resulting profiles to metabolites in 1H-NMR databases. Extracts were briefly sonicated and transferred to a 3 mm NMR tube.","MTBLS116"
"NMR spectroscopy","1H-NMR profiles were obtained using a 500 MHz Varian Unity Inova spectrometer equipped with a 1H/x-broadband 3 mm probe.","MTBLS116"
"NMR assay","Spectra were acquired using a water suppression pulse sequence (PRESAT), consisting of 132 (extraction method 1) or 64 (extraction method 2) transients of 32 K data-points with a relaxation delay of 1 s (extraction method 1) or 3 s (extraction method 2) over a spectral window of 5500 Hz. Resulting spectra were zero-filled to 64 K and multiplied by a line-broadening factor of 0.5 Hz prior to Fourier transformation.","MTBLS116"
"Data transformation","Spectra were imported in to MestreNova (Mestrelabs version 7.1.2), where spectral baselines were adjusted using Whittiker smoothing and normalized to the total area. Three alignments were created to compare 1H-NMR (1) profile variability, (2) spectra spiked with the metabolite cocktails, and (3) fingerprints among coral species. All alignments were reduced to ASCII files. Variables corresponding to the residual water impurity (4.48–4.92 ppm) and an observed acetone contaminant (2.22–2.27 ppm) were removed. Alignments were imported into Metabolink (http://metabolink.knoesis.org), where a dynamic adaptive binning routine was used to identify each peak as a separate variable. For each alignment, bins were found between 0.5 to 10 ppm. R statistical environment (version 3.0.0, R Development Core Team 2013, http://www.R-project.org) was used for all further analysis, including normalizing spectral intensities to extract weights for comparison across samples.","MTBLS116"
"Metabolite identification","To determine which variables drive separation in metabolite composition among coral species, variable coefficients from the OPLS-DA model were compared to their null distributions. Null distributions were calculated by refitting the OPLS-DA model to the data, in which each variable is independently and randomly permuted to remove correlation structure. The actual coefficients were compared to their null distributions and variables in the tails (a = 0.01) were determined to significantly contribute to the model.To facilitate identification of the metabolites driving separation between species, a statistical total correlation spectroscopy analysis (STOSCY) in the R package MUMA was used to determine strong correlations between 1H-NMR variables. Highly correlated variables (r2>0.9) were assumed to originate from the same compound. Metabolites were assigned by matching peak positions and patterns to Chenomx 500 MHz spectral libraries.","MTBLS116"
"Data analysis","To investigate variability in 1H-NMR spectra, relative standard deviations were calculated across variables for each group. A Kruskal-Wallis analysis was applied to compare values among technical, intra-, and inter-colony spectra from Porites compressa.In the spiking experiment, Chenomx NMR Suite 7.6 (Chenomx, Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) was used to identify and quantify 1H-NMR signals resulting from the metabolite spikes. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to statistically compared metabolite concentrations of alanine, glucose, and glycolic acid among treatment groups.All variables from the three alignments were scaled to unity and mean centered prior to multivariate analysis. Both principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminate analyses (OPLS-DA) were used to investigate patterns in variables arising from 1H-NMR spectra.PCA was applied to investigate patterns between 1H-NMR profiles. Additionally, PCA was used to screen for outlying samples. If spectra fell outside a 99% confidence interval and upon further inspection it was determined that NMR shims influenced resulting peak shapes and line widths, spectra were excluded from subsequently analyses.OPLS-DA was applied to discriminate between 1H-NMR profiles arising from (1) spiking treatments and (2) among coral species (for source code see http://birg.cs.cofc.edu/index.php/O-PLS). Model strength was assessed using both R2 and Q2 metrics. R2 values report the total amount of variance explained by the model in both the 1H-NMR data (R2X) and independent variables (R2Y; e.g., spiking treatment or species identity). Q2 reports model accuracy and is calculated by 10-fold cross validation. The resulting Q2 statistic was compared to a null distribution to test model significance (p<0.05).  When there are more than three groups, the resulting model is influenced by group order. To facilitate comparing metabolite fingerprints among spiking treatments and reef-building corals, we developed an iterative strategy based on the magnitude of Q2 to determine group ordering in the model. The algorithm finds the maximum Q2 value between the two groups with the largest separation along the t-axis. Additional groups are inserted into the model based on the magnitude of Q2. The overall Q2 value is determined from model projections after allowing groups to cluster together based on profile similarities.  Finally, the OPLS-DA algorithm calculates coefficients describing the contribution of each variable to the model.","MTBLS116"
"Chromatography","","MTBLS117"
"Data transformation","Acquired data (*.raw format) were processed using the software SIEVE v1.3 (Thermo Scientific) installed in a 12-core 64-bit PC workstation (Windows 7 Ultimate SP1, Intel Core™ i7 CPU, 24 GB RAM). Although the software is designed for the analysis of LC/MS data, with appropriate changes in the settings, we were able to analyse data obtained by DIMS. The acquired mass spectra between 0.6 and 1.2 min were processed. Obtained frames [rectangular regions of m/z vs retention time (RT)] were filtered based on their coefficient of variation distribution (CV) in the reconstructed ion chromatograms (RIC). Frame intensities were normalized to the total ion chromatogram (TIC) and frames with CV>0.5 were excluded from further analysis. The obtained data matrices were exported to Simca P+, after the removal of peaks corresponding to isotopes, for multivariate analyses.","MTBLS117"
"Extraction","1 ml of a mixture of methanol:ethyl acetate (50:50, v/v) was added to the pulverized samples followed by sonication in an ultrasonic bath Branson 5510 (Branson, Connecticut, USA) for 25 min. Samples were then transferred to an orbital shaker (Infors AG, Bottmingen, Switzerland) for extraction under continuous agitation (150 rpm) for 2 h at 24 ºC. Extracts were filtered through 0.2 µm filters (Millex-FG, Millipore, MA, USA) to remove debris and the volume of samples was adjusted to 1.0 ml. 0.5ml of the extract was taken in a glass autosampler vial for direct infusion Orbitrap MS analysis (DIMS). The extracts were sub-divided into equal portions of 0.25 ml for analysis in positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI-) electrospray modes, respectively. Finally, extracts were dried using a Labconco CentriVap refrigerated vacuum concentrator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) equipped with a cold trap.","MTBLS117"
"Mass spectrometry","For analyses in ESI+, 160 µL of a mixture of methanol:formic acid (0.1% v/v) (50-50, v/v) were added to the dried samples, whereas for analyses in ESI-, 160 µL of methanol:ammonium acetate (2.5 mM) were added. Finally, extracts were transferred into microinserters, which were consecutively placed in glass autosampler vials. An LTQ-Orbitrap MS Classic (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) mass spectrometer was employed and experimental events were controlled by the software Xcalibur v.2.2 (Thermo Scientific). The analyzer was equipped with a quadrupole linear ion trap, an Orbitrap electrostatic Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS) with a heated electrospray ionization probe (HESI-II, Thermo Scientific), and an Accela pump (Thermo Scientific). The source voltage was set to 3.2 kV (ESI+) and 4.0 kV (ESI-) and the capillary voltage to 5.0 V (ESI+) and -35 V (ESI-). The capillary temperature was set to 275 ºC. Sheath gas flow was set to 10 (ESI+), and 20 (ESI-) whereas no auxiliary and sweep gases were used. Samples (10 µL) were injected manually performing direct infusion at a flow rate of 10 µL min-1 using a 100 µL syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA). DIMS analysis was performed at a mass resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400 and spectra were acquired over the range of 50-1, 800 Da for 3.5 min. For selected samples MS/MS analyses were performed with the normalized collision energy set at 35 eV, the activation q set to 0.25 and the activation time to 30 ms. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 15 s. AGC target value was set to 5E5 for the Orbitrap and to 1E4 for the MS/MS analysis in the linear ion trap. ","MTBLS117"

"Extraction","1 ml of a mixture of methanol:ethyl acetate (50:50, v/v) was added to the pulverized samples followed by sonication in an ultrasonic bath Branson 5510 (Branson, Connecticut, USA) for 25 min. Samples were then transferred to an orbital shaker (Infors AG, Bottmingen, Switzerland) for extraction under continuous agitation (150 rpm) for 2 h at 24 ºC. Extracts were filtered through 0.2 µm filters (Millex-FG, Millipore, MA, USA) to remove debris and the volume of samples was adjusted to 1.0 ml. 0.5ml of the extract was taken in a glass autosampler vial for GC/MS. Finally, extracts were dried using a Labconco CentriVap refrigerated vacuum concentrator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) equipped with a cold trap. Methoxymation was performed by adding to the dried samples 80 µL of methoxylamine hydrochloride (20 mg/ml in pyridine) followed by incubation at 30 ºC for 120 min. In a second step, silylation was performed by adding 80 μL of MSTFA (37 ºC for 90 min). Derivatized samples were then added to microinserters (150 μL, Fisher Scientific Company), which were placed in autosampler vials (2 ml). ","MTBLS118"
"Chromatography","Samples (1 µL) were injected using a split ratio of 10:1 into a HP-5MS ultra inert (UI) capillary column (30 m x 250 µm I.D, 0.25 µm film thickness; Agilent Technologies Inc.). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min-1. The temperature of the oven was initially 70 ºC stable for 5 min, followed by a 5 ºC min-1 increase to 310 ºC and finally stable for 1 min. ","MTBLS118"
"Mass spectrometry","For analyses, an Agilent 7890A GC platform (Agilent Technologies Inc. Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with a 5975C series mass selective detector (MSD) and a 7693A series autosampler was employed. Electron impact (EI) at 70 eV was used. Full scan mass spectra were acquired at the mass range of 50 to 800 Da at 1 scan s-1 rate with a 10.0 min solvent delay. The temperature for the ion source was set to 150 ºC, for the transfer line to 230 ºC, and for the injector to 230 ºC.","MTBLS118"
"Data transformation","For data pre-processing (peak deconvolution, metabolite identification, and peak integration) the Agilent MSD Chemstation E.02.00.493 was used. Automatic integration was performed after optimization of the ChemStation Integrator parameters based on the total ion chromatogram (TIC). Processed chromatograms were exported to Microsoft excel for the creation of data matrices. Following retention time (RT) alignment, chromatograms were normalized to the TIC and the constructed matrix was exported to Simca P+ v.12.0.1 for the discovery of signatory metabolites and trends. To ensure the quality and validity of analyses, standard operating procedures (SOP) and quality control (QC) measures were applied throughout analyses.","MTBLS118"

"Sample collection","Samples were collected from the field according to the leaf plastochron index (LPI), tagged and frozen in dry ice.  For current year shoot segments, we defined LPI 1 as the first leaf below the shoot tip that was at least 1 cm in length (internode 1 would be directly above this), and counted down to collect internode 12.  For the previous year growth, internode 1 was assigned as below the terminal bud scar, counting down the stem to internode 7.   Since trees showed different amounts of growth (number of internodes) in a given year, a continuous internode counting down from the shoot tip to the previous year's growth was not applicable.  Samples in the laboratory were stored at -80 °C prior to processing, which was initiated by freeze-drying to a constant weight.  Twigs were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently ground in a P14 mill (Pulveristette 14; Fritsch) with a 0.5 mm sieve at maximum speed (20,000 rpm) to generate a fine powder.  The samples were collected in labeled, pre-weighed 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and dried, after which the mass was recorded.","MTBLS119"
"Extraction","Sample extraction was performed on 10 mg fractions using (50:50 LCMS grade MeOH:H2O, 1 ml).  The tube contents were mixed by vortexing, placed in a shaker (Boekel Sci; Feasterville, PA) and incubated 200 minutes at 30 °C.  The tubes were then removed, vortexed briefly and allowed to sit overnight at room temperature.  The samples were then vortexed and centrifuged (13,000 x g, 5 min, RT) with the extracts (450 µl) transferred to prelabeled, ethanol-washed tubes.  The samples were then concentrated via centrifugal concentration until approximately 200 µl remained and were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and dried overnight on high vacuum line with liquid nitrogen trap.

Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended.</p>The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 °C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 °C/min ramp to 350 °C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow.

"Metabolite identification","A complete matrix of peak heights representing arbitrary mass spectral ion currents of all available mass features was used for initial numerical analysis. Peak heights were corrected by the amount of cells using OD750 and to the recovered amount of the internal standard, ribitol, to yield normalized responses. These normalized responses were used to calculate response ratios, subsequently also called relative content, compared to the respective choice of control condition. Identification of metabolite-specific mass fragments from this data matrix was manually supervised.

The full experimental polytrauma and shock protocols have been described in detail previously [2][4]. Briefly, animals were instrumented and splenectomized. Polytrauma was induced by a captive bolt device to create a blunt percussive injury to the chest and a liver crush injury using a Holcomb clamp technique [5]. Hemorrhagic shock was then induced by withdrawal of blood from the inferior vena cava until a systolic pressure of 45–55 mmHg was reached for 45 min (S45) to simulate delay prior to medical attention. Typically, this resulted in withdrawal of ~40% of the pig’s blood volume. Blood was placed in an acid-citrate-dextrose bag for later use. Following the shock period, animals received lactated Ringer’s fluid given as 20 cc/kg intravenous(IV) boluses to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 80 mmHg for 1 h of limited resuscitation to simulate transportation to a medical center; then underwent full resuscitation protocol for the following 24 h. This resuscitation included fluid, shed blood, and ventilator support in a protocolized fashion. After the resuscitation period, animals were extubated and sent to recovery and subsequently euthanized.</p>At several time points throughout the experiment, peripheral liver and skeletal muscle biopsies were taken ranging in weight from 0.2 to 0.6 g. Biopsies were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until preparation for NMR analysis. Biopsies were taken at the following timepoints: baseline after the animal stabilized from instrumentation (B), 45 min after hemorrhage (S45), 2, 8, and 20 h after full resuscitation (FR2, FR8, FR20). Changes induced by hemorrhagic shock polytrauma and 'early' resuscitation were denoted as the difference between S45 and B (S45-B) and between FR2 and S45 (FR2-S45) respectively.</p>Serum:</br>Twenty-three (23) juvenile male Yorkshire-crossbred pigs were used in this study. Upon stabilization, and after the measurement of baseline variables,the animals underwent a simulated pulmonary contusion by using a captive bolt device (Ramset, Glendale Heights, IL) to create a blunt percussive injury with a 0.22 caliber load by placing the device under the front, right limb on the sixth or seventh rib from the bottom. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by the removal of blood via inferior vena cava catheter into acid-citrate-dextrose blood bags to obtain a systolic blood pressure of less than 50 mm Hg (typically 35-50% of total blood volume). A liver crush injury was induced using a modified Holcomb clamp technique with two crush injuries made in the liver parenchyma that result in a grade 2 liver injury[5]. The abdomen was closed after shock and hypotensive resuscitation. After 45 minutes of shock, animals received 1 hour of limited resuscitation (to simulate transport to definitive care), followed by 20 hours of a standard resuscitation protocol. Throughout the shock and resuscitation periods, animals were maintained on the ventilator and received an adjusted dose of propofol and nitrous oxide to maintain an appropriate level of sedation and comfort as evaluated by a clinical examination and a bispectral index monitor. At 20 hours following the initiation of full resuscitation, surviving animals had all lines removed, venous lines were tunneled for access, and the animals were closed in three layers. The animals were then awakened, extubated and sent to recovery and subsequently euthanized.</p>Blood samples were collected from the animals at baseline (before hemorrhage), at shock (after 45 minutes of shock), and at 8 hours of full resuscitation. After clotting, blood was immediately centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 g to extract serum, transferred to a clean tube, and stored at 4 °C overnight. All samples were then stored at -80 °C until prepared for NMR analysis.</p>Urine:Forty male Yorkshire pigs (Manthei Hog Farm, LLC, Elk River, MN) weighing between 15 and 20 kg were randomized to experimental group,  Negative control, (Positive) control, Fasted, and Pre-fed.  One control group underwent surgical preparation without shock or trauma (non-hemorrhaged). A second control group underwent all experimental interventions but did not receive resuscitation (non-resuscitated). Animals in the two experimental groups underwent all experimental manipulations as described below and differed in that one group received a bolus of 140 ml of Karo® Syrup with 140 ml water 30 min prior to experimental manipulation (pre-fed) while the other group received only water for 12 h prior to intervention (fasted). Urine samples from all forty animals were taken at set timepoints throughout the experiment. A total of 165 samples were obtained.</p>Ref: </br>[1] Lusczek ER, Lexcen DR, Witowski NE, Mulier KE, Beilman G. Urinary metabolic network analysis in trauma, hemorrhagic shock, and resuscitation.

"Extraction","Plasma samples were thawed and 100 microliters of plasma was transferred to 400 microliters methanol in 96-well format to precipitate proteins. This 80% methanol solution was stored at -20C overnight, and then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3800g in 4C to pellet precipitated protein. The supernatant was aliquoted to three separate 96-well plates, sealed using a heat-seal foil, and stored at -20C until analysis.  Plate analysis order was completely randomized for each set of injections, and plates were run in batches of two plates, reflecting the autosampler capacity. Within each set of two plates, the run order was again completely randomized to prevent injection order artifacts. Duplicate injections were performed for all samples, with the second set of injections performed upon completion of the first set of injections for all samples.","MTBLS124"
"Chromatography","One microliter injections of protein-precipitated serum were performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC system. Separation was performed using a Waters Acquity UPLC C8 column (1.8 micrometre, 1.0 x 100 mm), using a gradient from solvent A (95% water, 5% methanol, 0.1% formic acid) to solvent B (95% methanol, 5% water, 0.1% formic acid). Injections were made in 100% A, which was held for 0.1 min, ramped to 40% B in 0.9 minutes, to 70% B over two minutes, and to 100% B over 8 minutes. The mobile phase was held at 100% B for 6 minutes, returned to starting conditions over 0.1 minutes, and allowed to re-equilibrate at for 5.9 minutes. Flow rate was constant at 140 microliters/min for the duration of the run. The column was held at 50C, while samples were held at 10C.","MTBLS124"
"Mass spectrometry","Column eluent was infused into a Waters Xevo G2 TOF MS fitted with an electrospray source. Data was collected in positive ion mode, scanning from 50-1200 at a rate of 5 scans per second. Scans were collected alternatively in MS mode at collision energy of 6 V and in idMS/MS mode using higher collision energy (15-30 V). IdMS/MS (also called MSE or MSn) allows for unbiased view of MS/MS fragmentation without additional experiments5. Calibration was performed prior to sample analysis via infusion of sodium formate solution, with mass accuracy within 1 ppm. The capillary voltage was held at 2200V, the source temp at 150C, and the desolvation temperature at 350C at a nitrogen desolvation gas flow rate of 800 L/hr. The quadrupole was held at collision energy of 6 volts.","MTBLS124"
"Data transformation","Raw data files were converted to .cdf format using Waters DataBridge software for processing.","MTBLS124"
"Metabolite identification","Raw data were processed using XCMS software. Procedures to perform non-targeted metabolomics in large-population studies have been previously described by our group (Ganna A et al. A workflow for UPLC-MS non-targeted metabolomic profiling in large human population-based studies. bioRxiv. 2014); the code has been made publically available at https://github.com/andgan/metabolomics_pipeline. Metabolic feature detection, alignment, grouping, imputation and normalization were performed separately for each study. Each feature is characterized by a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time. A single metabolite is normally represented by more than one feature. Indiscriminant (id) MS and idMS/MS spectra were generated for all the significant features. Those with highly similar spectra, strong correlation and similar retention time were deemed to be from the same metabolite. We used the spectra to identify the corresponding metabolite. Four approaches were considered, in agreement with what has been suggested by the Metabolomics Standard Initiative.","MTBLS124"
"Normalization","First, feature intensities were transformed to the log2 base scale to approximate normal distribution. Second, potential sample outliers were identified by plotting the total intensity for each sample. Samples with extremes total intensities might indicate sample degradation or technical errors and these samples were excluded.  Third, an ANOVA-type normalization was used to take into account factors of unwanted variation [PMID: 11355567, 20838408]. Specifically, we fitted a linear regression for association between each feature intensity and several factors of unwanted variability. We then used the residuals from the regression as new feature intensities. The factors of unwanted variability can be identified by studying the association between several technical variables and the first principal components. In TwinGene we adjusted for the square root of the sum of the squared differences between original retention time and corrected retention time, analysis date, storage time and unknown cluster effect. Finally, feature intensities were averaged between technical duplicates to reduce the inherent instrumental variability. Features with poor correlation between duplicates were excluded. ","MTBLS124"

Cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at RT for 20 min. Seven hundred microliters of the hydrophilic extracts were transferred into 1.5 mL glass vials and evaporated to complete dryness under a nitrogen stream using a Reacti-Therm III heating/stirring module equipped with a Reacti-Vap III nitrogen evaporator (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Samples were dissolved in 50 µL of water and mixed by vortexing for 10 s. Samples were transferred into 1.5 mL reaction tubes and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min to remove remaining particles. Supernatants were transferred into new 1.5 mL reaction tubes. 13C-labeled extracts were pooled to create a homogenic internal standard. Prior to analysis, a 15 µL aliquot of each sample was transferred into a 1.5 mL glass vial with inlet (5 mm dia.) and 5 µL of 13C-labeled internal standard was added. Samples were mixed by vortexing for 5 s and placed into the autosampler.","MTBLS128"
"Mass spectrometry","Eluting compounds were detected from m/z 50-1000 using a micrOTOF-Q II hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source in positive mode using following instrument settings: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 3.0 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 8 L/min, 180°C; capillary, -2500 V; end plate offset, -500 V; funnel 1 RF, 180 V; funnel 2 RF, 200 V; in-source CID energy, 0 V; hexapole RF, 100 V; quadrupole ion energy, 5 eV; collision gas, nitrogen; collision energy, 10 eV; collision RF 150 V; transfer time, 70 µs; pre pulse storage, 7 µs; pulser frequency, 10 kHz; spectra rate, 1 Hz.

Mass calibration of individual raw data files was performed on sodium formate cluster ions obtained by automatic infusion of 20 µL 10 mM sodium hydroxide in isopropanol/water/formic acid, 49.9/49.9/0.2 (v/v/v) immediatly after the injection of the sample.","MTBLS128"
"Metabolite identification","Spectral deconvolution and metabolite identification was performed using the ALLocator web platform (https://allocator.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de). Pseudo spectra were initially created using the ALLocatorSD pipeline with the following settings: rtBegin(73); rtEnd(511); epsiolonMZ(0.005); epsilonRT(5.0); minCorrelation(0.75); minIntensity(0); labeled13C(true); omit1000DaMassDecomps(true); inputJobId(86) Metabolites of interest were searched for and the corresponding pseudo spectra were carefully revised. Exact mass measurements and 13C-labeling information were used to calculate sum formulae. Pseudo fragment spectra were compared to MS spectra (level 2) contained in the Massbank database. The identity of L-Glutamate, N-Acetyl-L-glutamate, L-citrulline and L-arginine was also confirmed by the measurement of authentic standards.","MTBLS128"

Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended.</p>The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 °C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 °C/min ramp to 350 °C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow.

"Metabolite identification","A complete matrix of peak heights representing arbitrary mass spectral ion currents of all available mass features was used for initial numerical analysis.

"Extraction","The particularity of 2D NMR for quantitative analysis is that the peak volumes depend on several factors in addition to the concentration. Building a calibration curve for each targeted metabolite is therefore indispensable—still, a single series of calibration samples containing all the targeted metabolites together is sufficient, and better reflects the complexity of the extracts. For this purpose, five calibration samples containing eight targeted metabolites at different concentrations were prepared in the phosphate buffer solution used to prepare the fruit extracts. The values of these concentrations (see Supplementary Table S2 in the paper associated with this study) were determined from previous profiling studies performed on tomato pericarp [1][2]. To keep a similar ionic force across the calibration range, the changes in the concentrations of these eight metabolites were not uniform.</p>As with the fruit extracts reported in MTBLS131 and MTBLS132, the calibration samples were also titrated with KOD to pH 6 using a titration unit BTpH (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) in 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution in D2O containing 2 mM EDTA.

"NMR spectroscopy","All the NMR spectra of the calibration samples were recorded three times at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III 500 spectrometer, operating at a frequency of 500.13 MHz with a dual 5 mm cryogenically cooled 1H-13C probe.","MTBLS133"
"NMR assay","For each experiment, the 90° pulse width was carefully calibrated and the water signal at 4.7 ppm was presaturated by continuous irradiation during the recovery delay. All experiments by ultrafast NMR were performed under partial saturation conditions, with TR = 5 s. All the ultrafast COSY experiments were recorded using the pulse sequence described previously [1], including the possibility to perform interleaved acquisitions. The final spectral width was 4.5 ppm in both dimensions at 500 MHz. The experiment duration is given by Ta = NS•N1 where NS is the number of scans and N1 the number of interleaved acquisitions. For the experiments performed at 500 MHz, the following parameters were used: NS = 64 and N1 = 1, as interleaving was not needed to sample the relevant spectral width. All the experiments were eventually performed with a ca. 5 min overall duration. For all the experiments, the spatial encoding was performed with two successive smoothed chirp pulses (60 kHz, 15 ms) applied together with 8.3 G/cm bipolar spatial encoding gradients. The mixing period included opposite coherence-selection gradients (sin shape; 58.5 G/cm, 0.8 ms). For the acquisition, 128 acquisition gradient pairs were applied, with the following amplitude and duration: 58.5 G/cm and 256 µs.

"Metabolite identification","Eight major polar compounds of tomato flesh, belonging to several metabolite families and implicated in fruit growth and quality, were selected for quantification. After annotation, the most isolated peak was selected for each compound. The peak volumes were measured using the 2D integration agent in TopSpin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). The integration region limits were optimized for each peak of interest on the highest concentrated mixture. Integration regions were centered on the peak of interest and their size was chosen as large as possible to integrate the whole peak but small enough to avoid overlap with neighbouring peaks. Identical integration regions were used for all the samples.</p>To evaluate the repeatability of the NMR quantification procedure, each spectrum (calibration and biological extracts) was acquired three successive times, and average values were calculated for each peak volume. Calibration curves were then fitted by the linear regression equation: V = a•[m] + b, where V represents the 2D peak volume (arbitrary unit, a.u.) and [m] is the concentration (in millimoles per litre) of the given metabolite in the calibration sample.</p>To determine the unknown concentration of the eight metabolites in the twelve tomato pericarp extracts, the volume of each target peak was measured with the same integration file as for the calibration samples, and the concentration was determined using the linear regression equation of the corresponding metabolite. (Tomato extract samples available at MTBLS132).","MTBLS134"
"Extraction","The particularity of 2D NMR for quantitative analysis is that the peak volumes depend on several factors in addition to the concentration. Building a calibration curve for each targeted metabolite is therefore indispensable—still, a single series of calibration samples containing all the targeted metabolites together is sufficient, and better reflects the complexity of the extracts. For this purpose, five calibration samples containing eight targeted metabolites at different concentrations were prepared in the phosphate buffer solution used to prepare the fruit extracts. The values of these concentrations (see Supplementary Table S2 in the paper associated with this study) were determined from previous profiling studies performed on tomato pericarp [1][2]. To keep a similar ionic force across the calibration range, the changes in the concentrations of these eight metabolites were not uniform.</p>As with the fruit extracts reported in MTBLS131 and MTBLS132, the calibration samples were also titrated with KOD to pH 6 using a titration unit BTpH (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) in 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution in D2O containing 2 mM EDTA. Then, trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate sodium salt (TSP, 0.01% final concentration for chemical shift calibration) was added. Titrated extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized during 12 h.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Deborde, C., Maucourt, M., Baldet, P., Bernillon, S., Biais, B., Talon, G., et al. (2009).

"Sample collection","L. creticus seeds were kindly provided by the Servicio Devesa-Albufera Ayuntamiento de Valencia, Viveros Municipales de El Saler, CV-500, Km 8.5, El Saler, Valencia (Spain). L. corniculatus var. San Gabriel and L. tenius (Lotus glaber) var. La Esmeralda were obtained from the LOTASSA consortium (http://www.lotassa.com). Seeds were germinated in plates containing half-strength BD agar [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. For the evaluation of survival to long-term lethal NaCl levels, seedlings (at least 40 of each species) were transplanted to pots containing a mixture of sand and perlite (1:1) irrigated with nutrient solution, and grown in the greenhouse under a 16/8 h day/night, 23 ± 2 °C and 55–65% relative humidity regime. Eight days post-imbibition, the salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in 25 mm NaCl steps every three days to reach 300 mm NaCl. This concentration was used to continue irrigation, until all the plants died. The number of dead plants as a function of time was recorded. Plants were scored dead when the whole plant or all the leaves were wilted or chlorotic. For the gradual salt stress acclimation experiments, seedlings were transplanted to soil (type Null Einheitserde, Wandorf, Germany) and irrigated with nutrient solution. The stress treatment was started 8 days post-imbibition. The salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in three steps of 4 day intervals from 50, 100 to 150 mm NaCl [2]. In two successive independent experiments, L. creticus was tested parallel to the other Lotus species. Each independent experiment included sample sets of control and salt-treated plants. Each sample set had at least five independent biological replicates and each replicate was a pool of at least five plants. The total duration of the cultivation was 32 d. Complete shoots, pools of leaves, petioles and stems omitting cotyledons were harvested in situ in the middle of the light period and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experimental design induced neither senescence nor was lethal within the cultivation period. At harvest, all plants were still in the vegetative stage and non-nodulated. Biomass was estimated by the mean fresh weight of the pooled shoot samples.</p>Ref: </br>[1] Broughton W.J. & Dilworth M.J. (1971) Control of leghaemoglobin synthesis in snake beans.

Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended.</p>The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 °C.

The mass range was split into a low mass range m/z 50-200 and a high mass range m/z 200-1000 and measured in two separate runs. The MS parameters were tuned for each method and polarity separately with selected metabolites. For the low mass range the best intensities were achieved with a capillary voltage of 25 V, tube lens voltage of 70 V, skimmer voltage of 14 V for positive and negative mode with changed polarity. The high mass range measurements were conducted with a capillary voltage of 55 V and -45 V, tube lens voltage of 115 V and -105 V, skimmer voltage of 22 V and -24 V for positive and negative mode respectively.The MS² analysis was performed with a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Feature intensities were normalized by a pairwise comparison between each sample and the sample with the most features. For each pairwise comparison we computed the average intensity ratio and multiplied all feature intensities in the respective map by the inverse.","MTBLS140"

Homogenized samples were stored at -80 °C prior to lipid extraction and analysis. All lipidomics analyses were performed by Zora Biosciences Oy (Espoo, Finland).","MTBLS143"
"Extraction","Lipid Extraction:</br>Robotic assisted 96-well sample preparation and extraction was performed using a Hamilton Microlab Star system (Hamilton Robotics, Bonaduz, Switzerland). A modified Folch protocol, using chloroform, methanol and acetic acid for liquid-liquid extraction [1], was applied to extract a broad lipid type spectrum [2,3]. This extraction procedure is efficient and robust over a wide lipid concentration range [4]. This method was used to extract glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sterol esters and sphingolipids, except for sphingosines and spingosine-1-phosphates which were extracted with 1.1 ml of ice-cold methanol containing 0.1% BHT. The Hamilton robot system was used to extract gangliosides using the methodology described by Fong and colleagues [5] with minor modifications. Eicosanoids were extracted according to the procedure by Deems [6]. Prior to extraction, the samples were spiked with known amounts of internal standards (IS). This set of ISs were used to quantify the endogenous lipids in samples and controls as described below. Following lipid extraction, samples were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Samples for shotgun lipidomics, sphingolipidomics and gangliosides were reconstituted in chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v), whereas samples for sphingosine/sphingosine-1-phosphate and eicosanoids were reconstituted in methanol. The final extracts were stored at −20 °C upon mass spectrometry analysis.</p>Ref: </br>[1] Heiskanen LA, Suoniemi M, Ta HX, Tarasov K, Ekroos K.Long-term performance and stability of molecular shotgun lipidomic analysis of human plasma samples.

"Data transformation","Samples from 2 month and 3 month time points were analyzed separately from 7 month time point. Variation in instrument control samples between the batches were observed in ceramide (Cer, LacCer, Glc/GalCer and Gb3 lipid classes) and eicosanoid lipidomics platforms, and therefore correction factors were applied to endogenous lipid concentrations of these platforms.</p>Due to the use of correction factors, the ceramide and eicosanoid concentrations at 7 month time point are relative instead of absolute. Group comparisons within a particular time point are not affected by the use of correction factors.</p>The variation of endogenous lipid concentrations was due to internal standard (IS) issues (eicosanoids) and variation in total lipid extraction (ceramide species). The eicosanoid IS concentrations were varying between the two batches, which was observed from control samples. Variation was most likely due to evaporation of solvent from the IS vials, even though the vials were unopened and stored as recommended by the manufacturer.</p>The correction factors were calculated based on instrument control samples (ICs), which are included in all extractions to monitor quality of the lipidomics analysis. Pooled human plasma is extracted in ICs instead of a sample, concentrations of ISs are the same as in samples, and the extraction is done in the same fashion for ICs and samples. Ten replicate ICs were run per one sample set.</p>Endogenous lipid concentrations of eicosanoids and ceramide lipid species on 7 months' time point samples were corrected by correction factors (k) obtained from the following equation. Peak area ratios (Endogenous area / IS area) from ten replicate IC runs were first calculated, and then averages of these ten ratios were used for determine the correction factors according to the equation. Obviously, the correction factors were determined only to those lipids, which were detected in IC. For ceramide species the calculation was done per lipid extraction of the tissue type, for example ICs in lung sample batches were compared with each other.</p>To calculate corrected concentration IS amount (pmol) in a sample was multiplied by k.","MTBLS143"
"Metabolite identification","The mass spectrometry data files were processed using LipidView™ V1.0.99 and MultiQuant™ 2.0 softwares to generate a list of lipid names and peak areas. Shotgun lipidomics data was processed in LipidView™ as described previously [1]. Briefly, the endogenous species were identified based on their characteristic fragment ions, neutral losses and parent ions. For instance, m/z 184.1 which is the characteristic headgroup ion of phosphatidylcholines (PC) and sphingomyelins (SM) [2] was used to identify together with the parent mass the peaks observed in the mass spectrum of PIS 184.1 in positive ion mode. In a similar way the monitored acyl ions were utilized to identify the molecular species in negative ion mode [3]. For instance, identification of PC 16:0-18:1 requires corresponding signals from both the 16:0 (PIS of m/z 255.2) and the 18:1 (PIS of m/z 281.2) scans. </p>MRM data was processed in MultiQuant™. The selected lipid characteristic ions and their parent masses in conjunction with retention time were used for the identification of the endogenous species. Information dependent acquisition (IDA) experiments were used for confirming identifications. MRM was used as survey scan to trigger the IDA, followed by enhanced product ion (EPI) scans of two most intense ions.</p>The identified lipids were quantified by normalizing against their respective internal standard and matrix type, e.g. volume for plasma, and presented accordingly (e.g. µM for plasma). Total lipid class concentrations were calculated by summing-up the concentrations of species belonging to the same class. Molar distribution percentages were generated by dividing all the observed lipid concentrations to the class total concentration within the sample.</p>Data filtering of the final data set was based on the frequency of individual lipid molecules observed throughout the collected data. Molecules observed from less than 75% of the samples, and molecules lacking lipid class specific internal standards were excluded. Molecules having four fold lower or higher concentration than the median of the group was considered as an outlier and excluded. Filtering procedures were performed separately for both polarity modes and lipidomic assessment, prior to merging of the final lipidomic data set. All the calculations and data processing were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute).</p>Ref: </br>[1] Ejsing CS, Duchoslav E, Sampaio J, Simons K, Bonner R, Thiele C, Ekroos K, Shevchenko A.

"Extraction","The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a previously described method [1]. Briefly, 1.5 ml samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g at 4 ºC for 30 minutes and the supernatant discarded.

The combined extracts were neutralized with 0.1 M ammonium hydroxide, dried in a vacufuge, and then re-dissolved in 1 ml of 90:10 (v/v) water:acetonitrile for analysis on the mass spectrometer.</p>Prior to sampling the extracellular metabolites, the cells were removed by gentle vacuum filtration through 0.2 µm Omnipore filters (hydrophilic PTFE membranes, Millipore). [2] have observed filtration may release intracellular metabolites into the exometabolome, and this potential bias must be considered in the discussion of our results. The acidified filtrate was extracted using solid phase extraction with PPL cartridges (Varian Bond Elut PPL cartridges) as previously described [3].

"Extraction","For non-targeted metabolic profiling,  50 μL of thawed plasma samples were collected and then precipitated by 200 μL of methanol. After centrifugation at 14000g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 mL polypropylene tube and 10 μL of the supernatant was injected into the HPLC–MS. A “quality control” (QC) sample was also prepared by mixing equal volumes (10 μL) from each plasma sample before sample preparation as they were aliquoted for analysis. This “pooled” sample was used to estimate a “mean” profile representing all the analytes encountered during the analysis.For shotgun lipidomics and carnitine Profiling 10 μL of plasma was placed in a 1 mL glass vial. Then 8 μL of the internal standards mixture consisting of ceramide (Cer, d18:1/17:0), phosphatidylserine (PS, 17:0), phosphatidylcholine (PC, 18:3), l-α-phosphatidylinositol (Soy PI), phosphoethanolamine (PE, 17:0), and phosphoglycerol (PG, 17:0) with a concentration of 10 μM for each lipid was added. Afterward, 800 μL of chloroform/methanol/water (20:10:1, V/V/V) containing 300 mM ammonium acetate was added again and the mixture was vortexed. After centrifuging for 10 min at 14000g, 10 °C on a centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), 100 μL of the lower organic layer was diluted with 100 μL of methanol/chloroform (2:1, V/V) containing 10 mM ammonium acetate.

The final extracts were then analyzed using a QTRAP 5500 System equipped with a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system (Shimadzu). Liquid chromatography and flow injection analysis–mass spectrometry were employed to acquire the data. The electrospray source was operated in the positive ion mode. Optimized source parameters were: ionspray voltage 5.5 kV, source temperature 300 °C, curtain gas 30. Collision energies ranged from 25 to 30 V for various lipid species in precursor ion or neutral loss scan modes. Flow injections analysis was performed with a mixture of chloroform–methanol–10 mM ammonium acetate in water (300/665/35, V/V/V) at a flow rate of 200 μL/min. Total analysis time per sample was 3.6 min. PC, PE, PS, PI, PG, Cer, and carnitines were monitored by consecutive positive ion mode PIS m/z 184.1, 141.0, 185.0, 277.0, 189.0, 264.2, and 85.1, respectively. ","MTBLS146"
"Data transformation","Data pretreatment including peak picking, peak grouping, retention time correction, second peak grouping, and annotation of isotopes and adducts was achieved using XCMS and CAMERA software implemented with the freely available R statistical language (v 2.13.1).(24) LC–MS raw data files were initially converted into netCDF format then directly processed by the XCMS and CAMERA agentbox. A list of the ion intensities of each peak detected was generated using retention time (RT) and the m/z data pairs as identifiers for each ion. The resulting three-dimensional matrix contained arbitrarily assigned peak indices (retention time–m/z pairs), sample names (observations), and ion intensity information (variables).","MTBLS146"
"Metabolite identification","Exact molecular mass data (m/z) from significant peaks were used to search the online HMDB database (http://www.hmdb.ca) for metabolite identities. A metabolite name was reported when a mass difference between observed and theoretical mass was <10 ppm. Isotopic distribution measurements were used to further validate the metabolite molecular formula of matched metabolites. The identities of key metabolites were confirmed by comparison of their MS/MS spectra and retention time with those obtained using commercially available reference standards","MTBLS146"
"Sample collection","Plasma samples were obtained according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) de?ned for blood donation in Italy. The samples were obtained after overnight fasting and Ethyle- nediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as anticoagulant. The presence of EDTA does not affect the quality of the samples: the NMR spectral effects of any interactions between the added EDTA and endogenous components were found to be negligible, thus for plasma samples collected using EDTA as anticoagulant, useful biochemical information can be recovered effectively by metabolomics. The plasma samples for the NMR analysis were obtained from the backup aliquots of samples that, according to the SOPs, are stored in the Transfusion Service for analytical purposes for at least 24 h after blood withdrawal. The plasma samples were stored at -80 °C immediately after collection for further metabonomic analysis.","MTBLS147"
"NMR sample","Frozen plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and shaken before use. A total of 300 µl of a sodium phosphate buffer was added to 300 µl of each plasma sample, and 450 µl of this mixture was transferred into a 4.25 mm NMR tube (Bruker BioSpin) for analysis.","MTBLS147"
"NMR spectroscopy","1H NMR spectra for all samples were acquired using a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) operating at 600.13 MHz with a 5 mm CPTCI 1H-13C/31P-2H cryo-probe including a z axis gradient coil, an automatic tuning-matching (ATM) and an automatic sample changer.","MTBLS147"

"Extraction","","MTBLS147"
"NMR Assay","One-dimensional (1-D) spectra of plasma samples were acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG; Bruker) spin-echo sequence to suppresssignals arising from high molecular weight molecules.  Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential function equivalent to a 1.0 Hz line-broadening factor before applying Fourier transform. Transformed spectra were automatically corrected for phase and baseline distortions and calibrated(TMSP peak at 0.00 ppm) using TopSpin (Version 2.1, Bruker). Each 1-D spectrum in the range between 0.02 and 10.00 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift bins, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using AMIX software(Bruker BioSpin). Regions between 6.0 and 4.5 ppm containing residual water were removed.","MTBLS147"

"Extraction","Samples for UHPLC/HRMS analysis were centrifuged (3,000 rpm for 5 min) and then diluted in deionized water (dilution 1/5: 20 μl of urine in 80 μl of water) prior to analysis.","MTBLS148"
"Chromatography","Analyses were performed on an Accela liquid chromatographic system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The UHPLC chromatographic separation was performed on a Hypersil GOLD C18 1.9 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an online prefilter (Interchim, Montluçon, France). The mobile phases were (A) 100% water and (B) 100% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. After an isocratic step of 2 min at 100% phase A, a linear gradient from 0% to 100% B was run over the next 11 min with a mobile phase flow of 500 μl/min. After returning to 100% A at 15.5 min, the column was then allowed to equilibrate for 3.5 min, leading to a total run time of 19 min. ","MTBLS148"
"Mass spectrometry","The LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was fitted with an electrospray source operated in the positive- and negative-ion modes. The software interface was Xcalibur (version 2.1) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass spectrometer was calibrated before each analysis using a calibration solution provided by the manufacturer (external calibration). Mass spectra were recorded from 75 Th to 1,000 Th with an AGC value of 5×10^5. The mass resolution of the analyzer was set to 30,000 (m/Δm, fwhm at 400 Th). The mass spectra were acquired in the reduced profile mode. In the positive-ion mode, the electrospray voltage was set to 5 kV, the capillary voltage to 8 V, and the tube lens offset to 65 V. The sheath and auxiliary gas flows (both nitrogen) were optimized at 35 and 8 arbitrary units (au), respectively, and the drying gas temperature was set to 275 °C. In the negative-ion mode, the electrospray voltage was set to -3.5 kV, and the capillary voltage and tube lens offset were set to -20 and -70 V, respectively; the sheath and auxiliary gas flows (both nitrogen) were 45 and 15 au respectively, and the drying gas temperature was 275 °C.</p>Biological samples were randomly analyzed and a quality control sample (QC: urine pool) was injected every 10 samples to check the performance of the analytical system in terms of retention times, accurate mass measurements, and signal intensities.","MTBLS148"
"Data transformation","Data processing</br>Automatic peak detection and integration were performed using XCMS software package [1]. Raw files were preliminarily converted to netCDF format with Xconvert (Thermo Scientific, Les Ulis, France). Data were processed using XCMS version 1.14.1 running under R version 2.8.1. The R language was installed on a Dell Eight-core Intel Xeon 3.00 GHz Processor with 16 Go RAM running Linux (Centos 5.2 x86_64). The matchedFilter algorithm was used and default values were set for all parameters except for fwhm, step, steps, mzdiff, and mzwid, which were set respectively at 4, 0.01, 2, 0.01, and 0.01 (for both grouping steps).</br></p>Intensity drift correction</br>Intensities of the 4 peak lists (2 experiments × 2 ionization modes) were normalized as follows. First, for each variable, a local quadratic (loess) model representative of intensity variation along passage order was built with the values of the quality control (QC) sample [2]. Intensities were then divided by the model predictions. For the positive peak list of Exp. 2, QC values were not representative, and variable intensities were divided by their median as no obvious drift was observed. Second, peak list intensities were scaled by multiplying each of the 4 blocks by a common factor equal to the geometric mean of the block raw intensity medians. Note that this last step is only aimed at providing intensities with meaningful values (otherwise relative intensities are close to 1) and does not modify univariate statistics (since nonparametric tests are used) nor multivariate modeling (because of unit-variance scaling). Normalization resulted in a decrease from the median of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the identified variables (see below) within the QC samples in Exp. 1 (resp. Exp. 2) from 24% to 5% (resp. from 14% to 11%). The few variables that remained correlated with injection order (< 5% and 2% for Exp. 1 and Exp. 2, respectively) were discarded.</p>Filtering</br>Variables with a mean intensity in the QC samples less than 2 times the mean intensity in blank samples (i.e., phase A: water with 0.1% formic acid), or with a coefficient of variation in the QC samples > 30% were filtered out.</p>Statistical analysis</br>Univariate correlation with time storage duration was tested by using the nonparametric Spearman coefficient of rank correlation [3] and controlling the false discovery rate [4] at a 0.01 threshold. All peak intensities of the metabolites showing significant variations were confirmed by manual integration using the QuanBrowser software, in order to avoid any false-positive or false-negative deconvolution that may have been generated with XCMS.</p>Prior to multivariate analysis, one observation from Exp. 2 with outlier distribution quantiles [5] (p=10-3 threshold) was discarded. Intensities were log10 transformed and variables were mean-centered and unit-variance scaled, prior to principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares (PLS) analysis with 2 components (with the storage duration as Y response). To assess the predictive performance of each PLS-DA model, cross-validation was used to compute the diagnostic Q2 value [6]. The statistical significance of Q2 was estimated by permutation testing [7]: the Q2 value was compared to the distribution of 103 Q2 values corresponding to models built after random permutation of the response labels.</p>Normalization, univariate and multivariate statistical analyzes were all performed using scripts coded and run in the R language and environment (R Core Team, 2013; version 3.0.2).

"Sample collection","L. creticus seeds were kindly provided by the Servicio Devesa-Albufera Ayuntamiento de Valencia, Viveros Municipales de El Saler, CV-500, Km 8.5, El Saler, Valencia (Spain). L. corniculatus var. San Gabriel and L. tenius (Lotus glaber) var. La Esmeralda were obtained from the LOTASSA consortium (http://www.lotassa.com). Seeds were germinated in plates containing half-strength BD agar [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. For the evaluation of survival to long-term lethal NaCl levels, seedlings (at least 40 of each species) were transplanted to pots containing a mixture of sand and perlite (1:1) irrigated with nutrient solution, and grown in the greenhouse under a 16/8 h day/night, 23 ± 2 °C and 55–65% relative humidity regime. Eight days post-imbibition, the salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in 25 mm NaCl steps every three days to reach 300 mm NaCl. This concentration was used to continue irrigation, until all the plants died. The number of dead plants as a function of time was recorded. Plants were scored dead when the whole plant or all the leaves were wilted or chlorotic. For the gradual salt stress acclimation experiments, seedlings were transplanted to soil (type Null Einheitserde, Wandorf, Germany) and irrigated with nutrient solution. The stress treatment was started 8 days post-imbibition. The salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in three steps of 4 day intervals from 50, 100 to 150 mm NaCl [2]. In two successive independent experiments, L. creticus was tested parallel to the other Lotus species. Each independent experiment included sample sets of control and salt-treated plants. Each sample set had at least five independent biological replicates and each replicate was a pool of at least five plants. The total duration of the cultivation was 32 d. Complete shoots, pools of leaves, petioles and stems omitting cotyledons were harvested in situ in the middle of the light period and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experimental design induced neither senescence nor was lethal within the cultivation period. At harvest, all plants were still in the vegetative stage and non-nodulated. Biomass was estimated by the mean fresh weight of the pooled shoot samples.</p>Ref: </br>[1] Broughton W.J. & Dilworth M.J. (1971) Control of leghaemoglobin synthesis in snake beans.

Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended.</p>The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 °C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 °C/min ramp to 350 °C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow.

"Sample collection","For these experiments, there was one chemotherapeutic (docetaxel) and three environmental perturbations (glucose deprived, hypoxia, and ischemia). For the chemotherapeutic perturbation, samples were taken at 0 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours. For the hypoxic and glucose deprived perturbation, samples were taken at 0 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours. For OCCs, medium was removed and cells were quickly washed with 1 ml PBS at 37 °C, which was aspirated off, and then 700 µl of 80:20 methanol/water solution at -80 °C was added immediately. The plate was then incubated at -80 °C for 15 minutes. After incubation, remaining cellular debris were harvested using a cell scraper (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA) for intracellular analysis. For OCSCs, the media-cell mixture was transferred to a filter cup (Microcheck II beverage monitor, Pall, Port Washington, NY) with a pre-wetted membrane (0.45 µm pore Express PLUS Polyethersulfone membrane, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and the medium was filtered from the cells. The cells were then quickly washed with 4 ml PBS at 37 °C. The filter was then removed and placed upside down in a petri dish containing 1.5 ml of 80:20 methanol/water solution at -80 °C. The samples were then incubated at -80 °C for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the petri dish was removed and the filter was flipped over and washed using the 1.5 ml 80:20 methanol/water solution to remove any debris still caught in the filter. An extraction blank was made for the OCSCs following the same procedure above but only 4 ml PBS was washed through the filter. For both cell types, the intracellular solution was then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube in a cold ethanol bath and centrifuged at 5,000 g for 5 minutes at -4 °C. The supernatant was retained, and the pellet was subsequently re-extracted twice in 100 µl of the cold 80:20 methanol/water solution, with all supernatants being pooled. Intracellular and extracellular samples were stored at -80 °C and -20 °C, respectively, until analysis.","MTBLS150"
"Extraction","Before derivatization, intracellular samples were vacuum concentrated in a CentriVap at 40 °C until completely dry. Samples were aliquoted so as to be already normalized to cell count: cell density at sample time had been measured on a hemacytometer, and the volume that was vacuum concentrated was varied for each sample in order to yield a final concentration of 3,000 live cell equivalents/µL after derivatization. The samples were derivatized following the protocol laid out by Fiehn, et. al. Briefly, 2.5 µl of 40 mg/ml O-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Santa Ana, CA) in pyridine was added to the dried sample and shaken at 1400 rpm for 90 minutes at 30 °C. 22.5 µl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) + 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO) was then added to the samples which were then shaken at 1400 rpm for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 21,100 g for 3 minutes and 10 µl of the supernatant was added to an autosampler vial. Samples were spiked with 0.10 µl of a retention time standard solution consisting of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and an internal standard of nonadecanoic acid methyl ester dissolved in dimethylformamide.","MTBLS150"
"Chromatography","A LECO Pegasus 4D instrument with an Aglient 7683B autosampler, Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph and time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) was used to analyze the samples. The instrument was controlled using ChromaTOF. A sample volume of 1 µl was injected into the split/splitless inlet at 250 °C in splitless mode.

The detector voltage was set to 100 V above the optimized voltage with the electron energy set to -70 V. The mass defect mode was set to manual with the mass defect 0 mu/100 u. The transfer line temperature was set to 320 °C and the ion source temperature was set to 220 °C.","MTBLS150"
"Data transformation","Sample files were first analyzed in ChromaTOF (LECO, St. Joseph, MI) to determine baseline, peak area, and peak identification. Briefly, settings included a baseline offset of 0.5, automatic smoothing, 1st dimension peak width of 24 seconds, 2nd dimension peak width of 0.10 seconds, and a match of 700 required to combine peaks with a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5 for all subpeaks. Peaks were required to have a S/N of 10 and have a minimum similarity score of 800 before assigning a name. Unique mass was used for area and height calculation. Analytes were then aligned across the sample files using MetPP (http://metaopen.sourceforge.net/metpp.html). After alignment, further processing of the data was done based on the procedure laid out by Dunn, et. al. Batch effects were removed from the intracellular data set using LOESS. To remove analytes that were not reproducibly detected, analytes for which more than half of the values were missing in the QC samples or for which the QC samples had a coefficient of variance larger than 0.5 were removed from the data set. Then, missing values were manually corrected using small value correction only if all the values were missing in the biological replicate. Analysis of final data set was performed using MetaboAnalyst (http://metaboanalyst.ca/).","MTBLS150"
"Metabolite identification","GC-MS spectra were compared to several libraries including the Golm Metabolome Library, NIST spectral libraries, and an in house library.

"Mass spectrometry","A LECO Pegasus IV D time of flight mass spectrum (TOF-MS) was used. The total MS method time was based on the GC method time with an acquisition delay of 240 seconds. The collection mass range was from 50 to 500 u. The acquisition rate was set to 200 spectra/second. The detector voltage was set to 100 V above the optimized voltage with the electron energy set to -70 V. The mass defect mode was set to manual with the mass defect 0 mu/100 u. The transfer line temperature was set to 320 °C and the ion source temperature was set to 220 °C.","MTBLS152"
"Data transformation","Sample files were first analyzed in ChromaTOF (LECO, St. Joseph, MI) to determine baseline, peak area, and peak identification. Briefly, settings included a baseline offset of 0.5, automatic smoothing, 1st dimension peak width of 24 seconds, 2nd dimension peak width of 0.10 seconds, and a match of 700 required to combine peaks with a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5 for all subpeaks. Peaks were required to have a S/N of 10 and have a minimum similarity score of 800 before assigning a name. Unique mass was used for area and height calculation. Analytes were then aligned across the sample files using MetPP (http://metaopen.sourceforge.net/metpp.html). After alignment, further processing of the data was done based on the procedure laid out by Dunn, et. al. Batch effects were removed from the intracellular data set using LOESS. To remove analytes that were not reproducibly detected, analytes for which more than half of the values were missing in the QC samples or for which the QC samples had a coefficient of variance larger than 0.5 were removed from the data set. Then, missing values were manually corrected using small value correction only if all the values were missing in the biological replicate. Analysis of final data set was performed using MetaboAnalyst (http://metaboanalyst.ca/).","MTBLS152"
"Metabolite identification","GC-MS spectra were compared to several libraries including the Golm Metabolome Library, NIST spectral libraries, and an in house library. Analytes were identified by mass spectra comparison to the libraries with a cut-off of 700/1000. Metabolites were identified from the annotated analytes by comparison to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) or the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB); if they were listed in KEGG or HMDB they were identified as metabolites.

"Sample collection","Samples were taken at 0 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 8 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours to capture both short- and long-term metabolic profiles. For OCCs, medium was removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for extracellular analysis. Cells were then quickly washed with 1ml PBS at 37 °C, which was aspirated off, and then 700 µl of 80:20 methanol/water solution at -80 °C was added immediately. The plate was then incubated at -80 °C for 15 minutes. After incubation, remaining cellular debris were harvested using a cell scraper (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA) for intracellular analysis. For OCSC cells, the media-cell mixture was transferred to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1,900 g for 30 seconds at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for extracellular analysis. The cell pellet was quickly resuspended in 1 ml PBS at 37 °C and then immediately centrifuged again at 1,900 g for 30 seconds at room temperature. The wash solution was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 700 µl of 80:20 methanol/water at -80 °C. The samples were then incubated at -80 °C for 15 minutes.For both cell types, the intracellular solution was then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube in a cold ethanol bath and centrifuged at 5,000 g for 5 minutes at -4 °C. The supernatant was retained, and the pellet was subsequently re-extracted twice in 100 µl of the cold 80:20 methanol/water solution, with all supernatants being pooled. Intracellular and extracellular samples were stored at -80 °C and -20 °C, respectively, until analysis.Immediately before two dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) analysis, an acetonitrile precipitation was performed on the extracellular samples to remove protein. Briefly, the extracellular samples were thawed on ice and 75 µl was removed for GCxGC-MS analysis. 150 µl of ice-cold acetonitrile was added to the sample, and the sample was vortexed for one minute. The sample was then centrifuged at 21,100 g for 7 minutes, and the supernatant removed for GCxGC-MS analysis.","MTBLS152"
"Sample collection","Thalassiosira pseudonana (CCMP #1335) was cultured axenically in a modified version of L1 media made with Turks Island Salts in order to reduce the background concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the media. The phosphate-replete treatment contained 36 µM PO4 and the phosphate-limited treatment had 0.4 µM PO4. Prior to the experiment, the culture had been maintained through two culture transfers of phosphate-replete or phosphate-limited media. The experiment began with the addition of 30 ml of T. pseudonana in exponential phase to two-thirds of the flasks which contained 300 ml of media. The remaining one-third of the flasks were designated as cell-free controls. Two flasks with cells and one cell-free control for each media (phosphate-replete or phosphate-limited) were sampled at four time points: 0, 2, 8, and 10 days.","MTBLS154"
"Extraction","The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a method modified from a protocol previously described in [1].

"Sample collection","Synechococcus elongatus CCMP 1631 was purchased from the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (Boothbay, ME, USA) and grown in 300 ml of L1-Si media (https://ncma.bigelow.org/algal-recipes) using Turks Island Salts as a base.  A starter culture in exponential phase was used to inoculate 12 flasks of media with 10% of the volume (30 ml).  Another six flasks contained only the media as cell-free  controls.  The cultures were maintained at room temperature under a 12:12 light:dark regime (56 μmol/m2/s) and were sampled at approximately 30 min into the light cycle, at each time point.  Cultures were grown for three weeks and samples were taken on days: 0, 2, 8, 10, 15, and 17.  Cells were captured by gentle vacuum filtration on 0.2 µm Omnipore (Millipore) filters. The filtrate was acidified to a pH=3 and extracted immediately. The filters were stored at  80 ºC until extraction could occur in one batch for the entire experiment. ","MTBLS155"

"Sample collection","Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 [DSM 15171] was purchased from ATCC (Catalog #700808). The bacteria were grown in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with glass wool in the neck in the dark at 23 ˚C. At each time point two duplicate flasks were sacrificed for both treatments. Media blanks (""cell-free controls"") for each substrate were extracted at 0, 40, and 72 hours. The defined media (total volume = 120 ml) was made with 0.2 μm-filtered seawater collected near high tide from Vineyard Sound (Massachusetts) in September 2013. Nutrients and carbon substrates were added to the media in the concentrations in the following concentrations:Sodium propionate(1 mM = 3 mM C), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP, 0.6 mM = 3 mM C), NH4Cl (6 g/25 ml), NaH2PO4 (36.2 mM), f/2 Vitamins Solution (2.34 ml added for 2.34 l of media), FeCl2-EDTA (0.1 M), ZnCl2 (0.001 M), MnCl2 (0.001 M), CoCl2 (0.1 mM).</p>The experimental samples were inoculated with exponentially-growing R. pomeroyi that had been pre-conditioned in the target media (two transfers). Cultures were sacrificed at 0, 32, 38(p)/43(d), 48, 60, and 72 hours. The third time point was offset between the propionate and DMSP treatments so that the same cell abundance was sampled in each treatment. These time points captured exponential and stationary growth phases in both experiments. Each culture was filtered through a 0.2 µm filter (Omnipore, EMD Millipore) using a glass vacuum filtration rig.","MTBLS157"
"Extraction","Intracellular Metabolite Extraction (adapted from [1])Filters were placed in cryovials and frozen at -80 °C immediately after filtration. Subsequently, three quarters of each filter was weighed and cut into small pieces with methanol rinsed scissors on combusted aluminum foil. The pieces of the filter were placed in an 8 ml combusted amber glass vial and 1 ml of -20 °C 40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water + 0.1 M formic acid was added to each vial. 25 µl of 1 µg/ml deuterated standard mix (d3-glutamic acid, d4-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and d5-taurocholate) were added to act as extraction recovery standards. The vials were vortexed to shake apart filter pieces and fully expose them to the ice-cold solvent. They were sonicated for 10 minutes and the extract was transferred to micro-centrifuge tubes using Pasteur pipettes. The filter pieces were rinsed with 200 µl of extraction solvent and the rinse was added to the eppendorf tubes as well. The extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to new 8 ml amber glass vials leaving behind any scraps of filter or pieces of cellular detritus. The extracts were neutralized with 26 µl of 6 M ammonium hydroxide and dried down in a vacufuge. The samples were reconstituted in 495 µl 95:5 water:acetonitrile and 5 µl of 5 µg/ml deuterated biotin (injection standard). The solution (100 µl) was placed in a glass insert in an autosampler vial for targeted metabolomic analysis. From this same solution 250 µl was removed and placed in a new vial, dried down, and brought up 500 µl 0.01 M HCl. The solution was pulled through a 50 mg Varian PPL cartridge that was pre-rinsed with 1 ml methanol. The cartridge was rinsed with 2 ml 0.01 M HCl, dried for five minutes by pulling air through the cartridge, and then the sample was eluted from the cartridge with 1 ml methanol.

The column was re-equilibrated for 8.5 min in between analyses.","MTBLS157"
"Mass spectrometry","Untargeted analyses were conducted using a hybrid linear ion trap - 7T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS; LTQ FT Ultra, Thermo Scientific) with an electrospray ionization source. The instrument is externally calibrated weekly with a standard mix from the manufacturer. In parallel to the high resolution full MS scan in the FT-ICR cell (R = 100,000 defined at 400 m/z), the top four most abundant ions that exceeded 500 counts in the ion trap were fragmented. For the intracellular analysis, between every six samples the following sequence was run: Milli-Q blank, standard mix quality control, Milli-Q blank, two pooled samples (one for conditioning and one for feature validation).</p>The targeted method used a Thermo Scientific triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a heated electrospray ionization source. A mixture containing the standards for all of the targeted metabolites was run at 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng/ml concentrations. For the extracellular samples a 500 ng/ml standard mix was run approximately every six samples as quality control with a Milli-Q blank run before and after. In the intracellular samples a pooled sample of all the experimental samples was run after the second Milli-Q sample to re-condition the column.","MTBLS157"
"Data transformation","The untargeted data was processed using XCMS [1][2][3] and CAMERA [4]. Peak picking and alignment were carried out separately for the intracellular and extracellular samples. The files were converted from Thermo RAW files to mzML files using MSConvert [5]. In negative ion mode the peak threshold was set to an absolute intensity of 1000 in MSConvert before processing in XCMS. XCMS settings included: method = centWave, ppm = 2 (negative ion mode), 3 (positive ion mode), signal-to-noise = 10. The retention time correction setting and group.density were also used. Fragmentation mass spectra had a signal-to-noise threshold of 1. For the intracellular samples, pooled samples were used as an additional quality control. The average of each feature in the pooled samples or the experimental samples had to be greater than 1000. The coefficient of variance (100*standard deviation of feature/mean of feature) for each feature in the experimental samples and the pooled samples was calculated and only features that had a higher coefficient of variance in the experimental samples than in the pooled samples were retained for consideration [6].</p>The list of features defined by a retention time and mass-to-charge ratio was further refined by removing any features found in the samples whose average was less than five times higher than the average of all the media blanks. In addition, features had to be present in both biological replicates at two different sampling points. This accounted for compounds that might be found in the seawater but were also being produced by the bacteria. To compare overall differences in metabolite composition in the samples, non-metric multidimensional scaling using Bray-Curtis distances was used.</p>The targeted data was processed using Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific software). Standard curves were assessed individually and low quality peaks removed. The media controls were subtracted from the intracellular samples and used as a starting point reference for the extracellular samples.</p>Ref: </br>[1] Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.

"Sample collection","L. creticus seeds were kindly provided by the Servicio Devesa-Albufera Ayuntamiento de Valencia, Viveros Municipales de El Saler, CV-500, Km 8.5, El Saler, Valencia (Spain). L. corniculatus var. San Gabriel and L. tenius (Lotus glaber) var. La Esmeralda were obtained from the LOTASSA consortium (http://www.lotassa.com). Seeds were germinated in plates containing half-strength BD agar [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. For the evaluation of survival to long-term lethal NaCl levels, seedlings (at least 40 of each species) were transplanted to pots containing a mixture of sand and perlite (1:1) irrigated with nutrient solution, and grown in the greenhouse under a 16/8 h day/night, 23 ± 2 °C and 55–65% relative humidity regime. Eight days post-imbibition, the salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in 25 mm NaCl steps every three days to reach 300 mm NaCl. This concentration was used to continue irrigation, until all the plants died. The number of dead plants as a function of time was recorded. Plants were scored dead when the whole plant or all the leaves were wilted or chlorotic. For the gradual salt stress acclimation experiments, seedlings were transplanted to soil (type Null Einheitserde, Wandorf, Germany) and irrigated with nutrient solution. The stress treatment was started 8 days post-imbibition. The salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in three steps of 4 day intervals from 50, 100 to 150 mm NaCl [2]. In two successive independent experiments, L. creticus was tested parallel to the other Lotus species. Each independent experiment included sample sets of control and salt-treated plants. Each sample set had at least five independent biological replicates and each replicate was a pool of at least five plants. The total duration of the cultivation was 32 d. Complete shoots, pools of leaves, petioles and stems omitting cotyledons were harvested in situ in the middle of the light period and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experimental design induced neither senescence nor was lethal within the cultivation period. At harvest, all plants were still in the vegetative stage and non-nodulated. Biomass was estimated by the mean fresh weight of the pooled shoot samples.</p>Ref: </br>[1] Broughton W.J. & Dilworth M.J. (1971) Control of leghaemoglobin synthesis in snake beans.

Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended.</p>The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 °C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 °C/min ramp to 350 °C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow. The transfer line temperature is set to 250 °C and matches ion source conditions.</p>The n-alkanes used to calculate are retention time index were as follows: decane, dodecane, pentadecane, octadecane, nonadecane, docosane, octacosane, dotriacontane, hexatriacontane.

"Sample collection","The participants in this study comprised adult patients, who were prospectively recruited from the hepatology clinics at Georgetown University Hospital (GUH), Washington, DC. All patients provided informed consent and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Georgetown University. All patients were diagnosed to have liver cirrhosis on the basis of established clinical, laboratory and/or imaging criteria. Cases were diagnosed to have HCC based on well-established diagnostic imaging criteria and/or histology. Controls were required to be HCC free for at least 6 months from the time of study entry. Human blood was drawn from adult patients and collected by venepuncture into 10 ml BD Vacutainer sterile vacuum tubes without the presence of anticoagulant. The blood was immediately centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The serum supernatant was carefully collected and centrifuged at 2500 x g for 10 min at room temperature.

"Mass spectrometry","The column eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer by electrospray.Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Q-TOF Premier (Waters) operating in both positive and negative mode. The capillary voltage was set to 3.2 kV and 3 kV, and the cone voltage of 30 V and 20 V, respectively. The desolvation gas flow was set to 800 l/h and the temperature was set to 350 °C. The cone gas flow was 25 l/h, and the source temperature was 120 °C. Accurate mass was maintained by introduction of LockSpray interface of sulfadimethoxine (311.0814 [M+H]+ or 309.0658 [M-H]-) at a concentration of 250 pg/μl in 50% aqueous ACN and a rate of 150 μl/min. UPLC-QTOF data were acquired in centroid mode from 50 to 850 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in MS scanning using the MassLynx software (Waters).","MTBLS17"
"Data transformation","The raw data were converted into Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) format using the MassLynx software (Waters). We used the XCMS package to preprocess each of the three UPLC-QTOF MS datasets separately. The first step in XCMS is to detect the peaks. The peak detection algorithm first cuts the UPLC-QTOF data into slices, a fraction of a mass unit wide, and then applies a model peak matched filter on those individual slices over the chromatographic time domain. After detecting peaks in individual samples, the peaks are matched across samples to allow calculation of retention time (RT) deviations and relative ion intensity comparison. This is accomplished using a grouping method that uses kernel density estimation to group peaks in the mass domain. The peak matching algorithm in XCMS takes into account the two-dimensional anisotropic nature of data. These groups are then used to identify and correct drifts in RT from run to run. Following data preprocessing, ion annotation is conducted to identify derivative ions such as isotopes, adducts, and in-source fragments. This helps group ions that originated from the same metabolite on the basis of their monoisotopic masses and elution profiles. We used the R-package CAMERA for ion annotation.","MTBLS17"
"Metabolite identification","For difference detection, in-house developed MATLAB (Natick, MA) and R scripts were used on the basis of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests (t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In both statistical tests, we calculated the false discovery rate (FDR) to correct for multiple testing. To select ions with significant and consistent changes between HCC and cirrhotic patients in multiple experiments, we used an ion-annotation-assisted approach. This approach is designed to determine overlapping ions among multiple experiments by taking into consideration the presence of a large number of derivative ions such as isotopes, adducts, and fragments. This is accomplished by grouping ions into clusters, where each ion in a cluster is represented by its monoisotopic mass. This mass is then used to compare the ions across the three experiments. The common ions obtained based on monoisotopic masses using the ion annotation information are merged with those selected on the basis of their ion masses only. Putative identifications for the resulting ion list were obtained through mass-based search against four databases: the Human Metabolite DataBase (HMDB), Metlin, Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD), and LIPID MAPS. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) and MetaboAnalyst (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/) were used to perform enrichment analysis on a list of putative identifications of altered metabolites to identify a biological pathway that can be further investigated. Identities of some of the putative metabolite identifications were verified by comparing their MS/MS fragmentation patterns and RT with those of authentic standard compounds. Absolute quantitation of metabolite candidates was performed using isotope dilution technique by UPLC-SRM-MS analysis on the QTRAP 4000 and XEVO TQ instruments.","MTBLS17"
"Sample collection","Dried leaves of a single commercial brand of yerba mate tea (Taragui; Argentina; 100% leaves; I. paraguariensis) were purchased from a local international supermarket and finely ground to a particle size < 300 µm using a commercial food blender (Oster, Boca Raton, Fla., USA). Sterile deionized water was added to ground leaves at a ratio of 3.6 ml to 1 g ground tissue, was allowed to stand for 2 h at 4°C with occasional mixing to maximize extraction and was subsequently centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 min. Aqueous extracts were then subjected to dialysis at 4°C against deionized water for 36 h using a 3500 MWCO SnakeSkin® pleated dialysis tubing (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, Ill., USA). Dialyzed extracts were then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 min to remove large insoluble particles and frozen at -80°C.  Frozen extracts were lyophilized using Labconco FreeZone 12 L Freeze Dry System (Labconco, Kansas City, Missouri, USA) to concentrate them.  Lyophilized extracts were stored at room temperature in a sealed container until testing.  ","MTBLS170"
"Extraction","Lyophilized aqueous yerba mate extract was further extracted with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% solvent (methanol or acetonitrile) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min to separate them into two fractions: the pellet (not soluble in solvent concentration) and the supernatant (soluble in solvent concentration).  Fractions were subsequently dried using a SpeedVac Concentrator (Savant Industries, Inc., Farmingdale, N.Y., USA).  Lyophilized solvent-extracts were weighed, resuspended in sterile water to a concentration of 40 mg/ml and stored at -20 °C until bio-assays or derivitization for GC-MS.","MTBLS170"
"Chromatography","Samples were filtered using 0.2 µm nylon membrane filters (13 mm Acrodisc; Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, Mich., USA). Fifty microliters of each sample (or the whole sample if less than 50 μl) and 15 μl of 1 mg/ml liquid sorbitol solution were then dried under a stream of sterile flowing nitrogen. Dried samples were derivitized by adding 500 μl HPLC grade acetonitrile followed by 500 μl N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubating at 70 °C for 60 min. After 2 d, 1 μl of each sample was injected by an autosampler into a 5975C inert XL gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., USA), fitted with an Rtx-5MS with Integra-guard (5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane) capillary column 30 m by 250 μm by 0.25 μm of film thickness.

"Mass spectrometry","This standard quadrupole GC-MS was operated with electron impact (EI) ionization at 70 eV, six 50 Da to 650 Da scans per second, and helium gas flow rate of 1.33 ml/min with the injection port in splitless mode. Temperatures were held at 250 °C for the injection port, 230 °C for the mass spectrometer source, and 150 °C for the mass spectrometer quad. The oven was programmed to start at 50 °C for 2 min, ramp up to 325 °C at 20 °C per min, hold for 11 min, and then cycle back down to 50 °C.","MTBLS170"
"Data transformation","Correction factors for the 2 samples with concentrations less than 50 μl were multiplied by intensity values to approximate 50 μl samples. Samples were also normalized with respect to the sorbitol (internal standard) 319 m/z spectral peak.Peak selection and retention time correction were accomplished using the XCMS functions group(), retcor(), and group() with parameters based on the default GC-MS parameters of XCMS Online (see publication supplementary files for detailed parameters).

The sample was collected into a 10 ml plastic graduated centrifuge tube at room temperature and then frozen at -20 °C at the ARC. The sample was transported on dry ice on the same day as collection and then stored at -80 °C for approximately one month (38 days) until processing.","MTBLS171"
"Extraction","Urine (50 µl) was treated with 50 µl of a urease solution (1 U/µl) as optimised by Abbiss et al.[1]. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 × g. Chilled (approx. -20 °C) methanol containing uniformly labelled 13C,15N-valine and 13C-sorbitol as internal standards (200 µl; 29.25 µg/ml) was added to the sample. Samples were agitated for 10 min at 1,200 rpm and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and 13,400 × g. Aliquots (50 µl) of the sample were transferred to 200 µl glass inserts (for 2 ml GC vials) and dried in an Eppendorf Concentrator Plus rotary vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf South Pacific Pty. Ltd., North Ryde, NSW, Australia). The dried extract was stored at -80 °C for approximately 2 weeks (15 days) until derivatization and analysis.</p>For the control protocol, metabolites were treated with 20 µl of methoxyamine-HCl (20 mg/ml in pyridine) and agitated for 90 minutes at 1,200 rpm and 30 °C in an Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort. Following this, 40 µl of BSTFA or MSTFA was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes at 300 rpm in the thermomixer.  5 µl of an alkane mix (C10, C12, C15, C19, C22, C28; 0.156 mg/ml; C32, C36; 0.313 mg/ml) in hexane was added to the final sample for the calculation of a Kovat’s Retention Index for each compound. For automated protocols (batch and in-time), reagents (methoxyamine-HCl, BSTFA or MSTFA, n-alkanes) were added using a CTC CombiPAL autosampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland) with an agitator and equipped with a gas tight, cone tip 25 µl syringe (SGE, Ringwood, Victoria, Australia). Automated procedures were kept the same as the control with the exception that 500 rpm (maximum setting) was used for both automated procedures and a temperature of 37 °C for both methoximation and trimethylsilylation was used for the automated in-time protocol as there was only one agitator. The automated batch protocol prepared a batch of samples and the automated in-time procedure used a staggered approach resulting in a sample being ready for immediate injection every 70 minutes.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Abbiss H, Maker GL, Gummer J, Sharman MJ, Phillips JK, Boyce M, Trengove RD.

"Mass spectrometry","An Agilent 5973N mass selective detector (Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used. The transfer line was set to 330 °C and the ion source was set to 200 °C. Ionisation was achieved with a 70 eV electron beam and the quadrupole mass analyzer was operated in full scan mode over the range m/z 45-600 with a scan rate of approximately 3 scans per second. The MS was calibrated and auto-tuned using PFTBA. The reproducibility (RSD) of internal standards was in the range 6-29% for all except one method which was 68%.","MTBLS171"
"Data transformation","Full scan data was processed using AnalyzerPro™ v2.7 (SpectralWorks, Runcorn, UK). The Ruby scripting program was used to align common chromatographic peaks as described in Gummer et al.[1]. Following this, manual alignment of data was required to align peaks of the same compound which had deconvoluted differently in different samples. Peaks which occurred in <10% of the samples were removed from subsequent analyses. Unless otherwise stated, peak area (x) was log transformed using the equation x=log10(x+1) for further analysis. Principal component analysis was conducted using The Unscrambler X v10.1 (CAMO, Oslo, Norway). All metabolites were assessed for statistical significance using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS v22). Where data were normally distributed (determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and variance was homogenous (determined by Levene’s test), two-way ANOVA was used to determine the effects of reagent and protocol on 1) number of deconvoluted peaks; and 2) total ion chromatogram (TIC) area. A one-way ANOVA was used to determine the effects of 1) reagent and 2) protocol on metabolite peak area. Where data were non-normal and/or variance was heterogeneous the Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis test were used. Main effects were analysed using Bonferroni post hoc correction for multiple comparisons. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was employed to determine significant correlations between the internal standard and total ion chromatogram area where appropriate. A 0.05 criterion of statistical significance and 95% confidence interval were employed for all tests.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Gummer JP, Trengove RD, Oliver RP, Solomon PS.

Putative identifications were made by comparing mass spectra with a user-generated library of metabolite standards (Metabolomics Australia, Murdoch University Node) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 2011 MS Search v2.0 library. Where compounds were identified using only the NIST library, identifications were made with confidence scores >70% and probability scores >20% (>70% of IDs were made with probability scores >50%). Identifications were made for all compounds where possible and assigned an identification level as per Sumner et al.[1] and score as per Sumner et al.[2].

"Data transformation","Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential function equivalent to a 1.0 Hz line-broadening factor before applying Fourier transform. Transformed spectra were automatically corrected for phase and baseline distortions and calibrated (glucose doublet at 5.24 ppm) using TopSpin 2.1 (Bruker Biospin srl). Each spectrum in the range between 0.20 and 10.00 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift bins, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using the AMIX software (Bruker BioSpin). Regions between 6.00 and 3.30 ppm containing residual water signal and the broad and intense absorption attributable to the Ficoll contamination were excluded in subsequent statistical analyses. The total spectral area was calculated on the remaining bins and total area normalization was carried out on the data prior to pattern recognition.","MTBLS172"
"Metabolite identification","Various kinds of multivariate and univariate statistical techniques were applied on the obtained buckets using R 3.0.2 in house scripts. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to obtain a preliminary outlook of the data (visualization in a reduced space, clusters detection, screening for outliers), partial least squares (PLS) and multilevel PLS (MPLS) were employed to perform supervised data reduction and classification. Canonical analysis (CA) was used in combination with PLS to increase the supervised separation of the analyzed groups. Accuracy, specificity and sensitivity were estimated according to standard definitions. The global accuracy for classification was assessed by means of a Monte carlo cross-validation scheme. Twenty metabolites (plus the antibiotic Cefuroxime), whose peaks in the spectra were well defined and resolved, were assigned. Signal identification was performed using a library of NMR spectra of pure organic compounds, public databases (such as HMBD, human metabolic database, and SDBS, spectra database for organic compounds) storing reference NMR spectra of metabolites, spiking NMR experiments and literature data [1]. The relative concentrations of the various metabolites in the different spectra were calculated by integrating the signal area [2]. The Wilcoxon test was used for the determination of the meaningful metabolites. False discovery rate correction was applied using the Benjamini & Hochberg method (FDR) [3]: an adjusted p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The changes in metabolites levels between two groups of spectra are calculated as the log2 fold change (FC) ratio of the normalized median intensities of the corresponding signals in the spectra of the two groups (Fold change). When two groups were constituted by individuals that could be compared in pairs (e.g. the same individual before and after anesthesia) a pairwise analysis was performed. Pairwise Wilcoxon test (univariate statistics) and multilevel PLS [4][5] were used to this purpose.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Psychogios N, Hau DD, Peng J, et al. The human serum metabolome.

"NMR assay","A 1D CPMG pulse sequence was used to analyze the serum samples. For each sample 64 transients were collected.","MTBLS174"
"Data transformation","For each spectrum, the region between 5.0 and 4.5 ppm, which contains the residual watersignal, was removed from the subsequent analysis. Taking into account the fact that plasmasamples were collected using two different anti-coagulant treated tubes (citrate or EDTA), infurther analysis regions with signals that belong to citrate and EDTA complexes wereremoved. In total five singlets and two multiplets were eliminated.  CPMG 1D spectrum in the range between 0.2 and 10.0 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift buckets, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using AMIX software (Version 3.8.4; Bruker BioSpin) giving a total of 466 variables. Bucketing is a means to reduce the number of total variables and to compensate for small shifts in the signals.  The spectra were normalized by probabilistic quotient method.","MTBLS174"
"Metabolite identification","All resonances of interest were manually checked, and signals were assigned on template one-dimensional NMR profiles by using matching routines of AMIX 7.3.2 (Bruker BioSpin) in combination with the BBIOREFCODE Version 2-0-0 reference database and published literature when available. Additional confirmation were done using data provided in our lab –data base containing spectra of standard  pure compounds. To assess which metabolites (i.e. NMR peaks) were significantly different between different sets a univariate paired Wilcoxon test was used. A P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.","MTBLS174"
"Extraction","Two extraction methods were used: a selective extraction (chloroform extracts) to target non-polar metabolites and a general methanol extraction for mid-polar and polar compounds. Chloroform extracts were prepared as previously described, using the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) method (Tugizimana et al. 2012). Briefly, 24 h post treatment, the excess media was filtered using a Buchner funnel and the cells were collected. Two grams of cells were re-suspended in 20 mL of methanol and homogenised using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 5525 × g for 7 min at 25 °C. The supernatants were placed into 50 mL round-bottom flasks, and the methanol evaporated to 1 mL at 50 °C using a Buchi Rotavapor R-200. To this, 1 mL of the crude aqueous extract, 200 µL of chloroform and 100 µL of methanol were added.  The mixture was vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 15 000 × g for 6 min at 25 °C in a glass centrifuge tube. Using a syringe, the bottom chloroform extraction layer was removed and filtered through 0.22 µm nylon filters, and placed into pre-labelled GC glass vials containing glass inserts and fitted with slitted caps. A general methanol extraction was carried out as previously described, with modification where necessary (Madala et al. 2014; Tugizimana et al. 2014). The resulting 50% methanol extracts were filtered through 0.22 μm filters and placed into pre-labelled UHPLC glass vials fitted with inserts and slitted caps. ","MTBLS175"
"Chromatography","GC-MS = A 1 µl aliquot of chloroform sample was injected into the GC-MS instrument in splitless mode and the injection temperature of 250 °C. The overall programmed-temperature GC run included zones with different temperature gradient (multi-linear programming) with initial and final isothermal zones. The initial GC oven temperature was 40 °C for 4 min, increased by 25 °C min-1 to 240 °C, then increased to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C min-1 and held at 300 °C for 5.00 minLC-MS = A binary solvent mixture was used consisting of water (eluent A) containing 10 mM formic acid (pH 2.3) and acetonitrile (Romil Pure Chemistry, Cambridge, UK) (eluent B).

The conditions were kept constant for 3 min to flush the analytical column where after the column was returned to initial conditions at 27 min and allowed to equilibrate for 3 min. The run time was 30 min and the injection volume was 5 µl","MTBLS175"
"Mass spectrometry","GC-MS = The MS was operated using EI at 70 eV. Helium was used as the carrier gas, and the column flow rate set at 1 mL min-1. The ion source temperature was set at 200 °C, and the detector voltage was set at 0.5 kV to prevent the oversaturation of the detector. The solvent cut time for the MS was set at 5 min and EI scan mode was used for identification covering the range of 50-500 m/z. LC-MS = The SYNAPT G1 mass spectrometer was used in V-optics and operated in electrospray ionisation (ESI) mode to detect the compounds of interest. Leucine enkephalin (50 pg mL-1) was used as reference calibrant to obtain typical mass accuracies between 1 and 3 mDa. The mass spectrometer was operated in both positive and negative mode with a capillary voltage of 2.5 kV, the sampling cone at 17 V and the extraction cone at 4 V. The scan time was 0.1 s covering the 100 to 1000 Da mass range. The source temperature was 120°C and the desolvation temperature was set at 450 °C. Nitrogen gas was used as the nebulisation gas at a flow rate of 800 L h-1. The software used to control the hyphenated system and perform all data manipulation was MassLynx 4.1 (SCN 704, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA).","MTBLS175"
"Data transformation","The raw data was processed using the software specific to the analytical platform used. For GC-MS data, the Profiling Solution software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used for data processing. The parameters were default settings except for the following: 6 – 25 min retention time (Rt) range of the chromatogram, ion m/z tolerance of 500 mDa, ion Rt tolerance of 0.5 min and ion intensity threshold of 1000 counts. The timebase ‘Warping’ method was used for the chromatogram alignment. For LC-MS data, ESI positive and negative raw data were extracted using MassLynxTM XS software and analysed with MarkerLynxTM software (Waters Corporation, Mildford, MA, USA). The MarkerLynx software extracts the raw LC-MS data and produces a matrix of Rt-m/z variable pairs, with the m/z peak intensity for each sample. Software parameters were set to analyse the 2-26 min Rt range of the chromatogram, mass range 100-700 Da, mass tolerance 0.01 Da, mass window 0.05 Da and a Rt window of 0.20 min. The data matrices obtained from Profiling Solution (GC-MS data) and MarkerLynx (LC-MS) processing were exported to SIMCA 13.0 software (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis / orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA).XCMS analyses of LC-MS data = Following the upload of the raw data files (netCDF), parameters for XCMS processing were as follows: centWave for feature detection (with 15 ppm as a maximal tolerated m/z deviation in consecutive scans, minimum chromatographic peak width of 5 s and maximum peak width of 20 s); obwarp method for retention time correction (profStep = 1, step size to use for profile generation). The chromatogram alignment parameters included: minfrac of 0.5 (minimum fraction of samples necessary in at least one of the sample groups for it to be a valid group), bw of 5 s (allowable retention time deviations) and mzwid of 0.015 (width of overlapping m/z slices to use for peak density chromatograms and grouping peaks across samples). The relative quantification of metabolite features was based on EIC (extracted ion chromatogram) areas, and statistical test was performed using unpaired parametric t-test (Welch t-test) method, with p-value and fold change thresholds of 0.01 and 1.5 respectively for highly significant features and p-value threshold of 0.05 for significant features.","MTBLS175"
"Metabolite identification","The selected mass ions from the SIMCA-derived S- and Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) plots were putatively annotated according to the Metabolomic Standards Initiative, level 2 (Sumner et al. 2007). For the LC-MS platform, selected mass ions obtained from MarkerLynx data were putatively identified using the Taverna workbench (www.taverna.org.uk) for PUTMEDID_LCMS metabolite identification workflows. The Taverna workflows allow for integrated, automated and high-throughput annotation and putative metabolite identification from LC-ESI-MS metabolomic data. The workflows consist of correlation analysis, metabolic feature annotation and metabolite annotation (Brown et al. 2011). For the GC-EI-MS platform, the respective mass spectra of the extracted ion peaks of the selected mass ions from S- and VIP plots were searched against the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Wiley mass spectra libraries (2007 versions) for similarity matches. This spectral comparison provided putative empirical formulae and structures, which were further searched in databases such as the Dictionary of Natural Products (www.dnp.chemnetbase.com) and ChemSpider (www.chemspider.com). The library search results were evaluated based on the probability factor, a match factor provided by the search algorithms that describes how unique a spectrum is, compared to all other spectra in the library (Kanani and Klapa 2007; Kanani et al. 2008). Only spectra with probability hits in the range from 650 to 900 or above, were considered.The statistically selected features in XCMS analyses are automatically annotated by searching the METLIN metabolite database, producing thus a list of putative identities based on accurate mass measurements. In this study, the XCMS online annotation parameters were set as follows: isotopes and adducts search, m/z absolute error of 0, ppm error of 5 and the tolerance for database search of 10 ppm.","MTBLS175"

"3D MALDI imaging MS dataset of a mouse kidney ","The dataset comprises 75 sections from the central part of a mouse kidney that was PAXgene® fixed and paraffin embedded. The matrix was applied using a vaporization sprayer (ImagePrep™, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Spectra were acquired using a Bruker Daltonics Autoflex speed™ MALDI mass spectrometer in linear positive mode in the mass range of 2,000-20,000 m/z and a deflection of 1,500 m/z. In total, the dataset comprised 1,362,830 spectra, each containing 7,680 data points. Each spectrum was acquired with 200 laser shots, and the random walk option was set to 20 shots per position. A medium-size laser focus was chosen, so as to be suitable for the selected lateral resolution of 50 μm pixel size. During the data acquisition, the spectra preprocessing included a Gaussian spectral smoothing with a width of 2 within 4 cycles as well as baseline reduction using the Top Hat algorithm. The data for all 75 sections were imported into the software SCiLS Lab (SCiLS, Bremen, Germany) version 2014b. The registration of individual sections was performed with the aim to reconstruct the original relations between the sections. For this purpose, the so-called user-guided rigid registration was used, and this was performed interactively as follows. First, the first of the consecutive sections was placed in the center of the software view. Then, each of the following sections was positioned over the previous image and moved in the x- and y-directions and rotated with the help of the interactive software (keyboard, mouse); the half-transparent overlap with the previous image helps evaluate the positioning. The method allows for compensation of rotations and translations.

To construct a 3D volume that resembled the length, width, and height of the original agar block, a thickness of 1,500 μm per section producing voxels of 400 × 400 × 1,500 μm was chosen. The 3D volume was built up, starting with the first section from the day 1 post-inoculation dataset. After completion of image registration from the first time point, a spacing of 10.5 mm was introduced, starting with the block from the time point day 4. The same steps were repeated for the block from time point day 8 after inoculation. Besides these additional steps, the image registration was performed as described earlier for the 3D mouse kidney dataset. The complete dataset was then exported into the imzML format to produce the files.","MTBLS176"
"3D DESI-imaging MS dataset of a human colorectal adenocarcinoma","Sections from a single colorectal adenocarcinoma (n = 26) were analyzed by DESI-imaging MS. The tissue specimen was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a freezer at −80°C prior to cryosectioning at 10 μm thickness using a Microm HM550 Cryostat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Runcorn, UK) set at −16°C, and thaw mounted onto SuperFrost® Glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Distilled water was used to mount the sample to the sample holder, and the cryosectioning was performed without embedding medium. The built-in vacutome function of the cryostat was used to facilitate sectioning. The slides were stored in closed containers at −80°C prior to analysis and allowed to thaw at room temperature under nitrogen flow prior to DESI-imaging MS acquisition.Sections were cut to a step size of 10 μm, and every tenth section was imaged. Four sequential sections were deposited on each slide. The instrumental spatial resolution was set to 100 μm, and analysis of every tenth 10 μm section resulted in 100 μm3 voxels.Imaging MS data were acquired in the negative-ion mode over an m/z range of 200–1,050 using a Thermo Exactive instrument (Thermo Scientific GmbH, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a home-built automated DESI-imaging source as described previously [Gerbig S, Golf O, Balog J, Denes J, Baranyai Z, Zarand A, et al.: Analysis of colorectal adenocarcinoma tissue by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometric imaging. Anal Bioanal Chem 2012, 403:2315-25.]. The solvent used for DESI analysis was methanol/water (95/5 v/v) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Nitrogen was used as a nebulizing gas at a pressure of 7 bar. The distance between the DESI spray tip and the sample surface was set to 1.5 mm; the distance between the DESI spray tip and the mass spectrometer was set to 14 mm; and the distance between the inlet capillary and the sample surface was 0.1 mm. The spray angle was 80°, whereas the collection angle was fixed at 10°. The spray voltage used for analysis was 4.5 kV. Each row of pixels was acquired as a continuous line scan over the sample surface and saved in a separate raw file. All Thermo raw files of one imaging experiment were then converted to imzML format using the imzML converter v1.1.4.5i. The imzML files were named with reference to the section number and location of the section on the slide. For example, in the file named “120TopL, 90TopR, 110BottomL, 100BottomR-centroid.imzML”, the top-right section was the 90th section cut from the sample at a depth of 900 μm. ","MTBLS176"

The necessary approval was obtained from the local Ethics Committee, approval No. 3008-12/10.3D MALDI imaging MS analysis was applied to 58 cryosections, each with a thickness of 10 μm. The sections were mounted on indium-tin-oxide-coated conductive glass slides (Bruker Daltonics) and stored at −80°C until use. After drying under vacuum for 15 min, the slides were washed twice for 2 min in 70% ethanol and thereafter for 2 min in 99% ethanol. The SA used as a matrix was applied using the Bruker ImagePrep™ device. MALDI imaging MS was performed on an Autoflex speed™ mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) in linear positive mode. Spectra were acquired in the mass range 2,000-20,000 m/z with a deflection set to 1,500 m/z. Each spectrum was a sum of 200 laser shots, and the random walk option was set to 25 shots per position. A medium-size laser diameter was selected for the chosen lateral resolution of 60 μm. In total, the dataset comprised 828,558 spectra with 7,680 data points per spectrum. The spectra were preprocessed during acquisition applying Gaussian spectral smoothing with a width of 2 within 4 cycles as well as baseline reduction using the Top Hat algorithm. The data for all sections were imported into the software SCiLS Lab, version 2014b, and rigid image registration was performed by user-guided stacking of the optical images as described earlier for the 3D mouse kidney dataset.

Frozen mats were thawed at room temperature and 100 µl each of Nanopure™ water and zirconia-silica beads (0.1 mm size; Biospec Products; Bartlesville, OK) were added, respectively, to the samples and vigorously vortexed for 2 min. This bead-beating process was repeated after the samples were maintained at room temperature for 5 min. A mixture of chloroform/methanol (400 µl; 2:1, v/v) spiked with 20 µg of 13C-labeled acetate (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number 282022-250) was added to each disrupted mat sample, and the mixtures were repeatedly vortexed to ensure thorough mixing.

"Chromatography","An Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled with a single quadrupole 5975C mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was used for all analyses. Samples were analyzed in duplicate by optimized GC-MS methods, which varied according to the classes of molecular targets as described below.</p>Acetate and propionate were quantified in a targeted fashion using 13C-labeled acetate as an internal standard. Briefly, mixtures of unlabeled acetate and proprionate at different concentrations were combined with constant amounts of 13C-labeled acetate in order to construct calibration curves. 13C-labeled acetate was then spiked into microbial mat lysates prior to extraction of metabolites, and the measured ratios of unlabeled acetate and propionate to labeled internal standard were used to accurately quantify the target molecules. A polar column (HP-FFAP; 30 m × 0.250 mm × 0.250 µm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara) was used. The temperature of the GC inlet was maintained at 200 °C, and samples (1 µl) were injected in splitless mode with a helium gas flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. A temperature gradient from 40 to 200 °C over 20 min was used, and data were collected over the mass range 20–300 m/z. To reduce any carry over arising from the direct injection of the aqueous layers (a mixture of methanol and water) from the metabolite extraction procedure, pure methanol blanks were analyzed between each sample. </p>For untargeted analysis of polar metabolites, extracted metabolites in the dried aqueous layers were chemically derivatized to trimethylsilyl esters as previously described [1]. Metabolite extracts were dried in vacuo again to remove any residual moisture. To protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric isomers, methoxyamine (20 µl of a 30 mg/ml stock in pyridine) was added to each sample, followed by incubation at 37 °C with shaking for 90 min. To derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms, N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (80 µl) was added to each vial, followed by incubation at 37 °C with shaking for 30 min. The samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and were analyzed on the same day. An HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies) was used for untargeted analyses. Samples (1 µl) were injected in splitless mode, and the helium gas flow rate was determined by the Agilent Retention Time Locking function based on analysis of deuterated myristic acid (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The injection port temperature was held at 250 °C throughout the analysis. The GC oven was held at 60 °C for 1 min after injection, and the temperature was then increased to 325 °C by 10 °C/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325 °C.

"Sample Collection","For whole-mat (i.e., intracellular and extracellular metabolites combined) analyses of volatile organic acids, polar metabolites, wax esters, and PHAs, core samples were collected from a microbial mat in the effluent channel of Mushroom Spring in the Lower Geyser Basin (YNP, WY) where the temperature of the water in the sampling area varied from 58 to 62 °C during the diel cycle. A cork-borer with an 8 mm inner diameter was used to collect the same volume of mat sample, and a razor blade was used to separate the top 5 mm of each mat core such that the analyses were focused on the top green phototrophic layer and the red-orange under mat layers in the zone that contain most of the biological activity [1]. The samples were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and immediately frozen in a Dewar containing liquid nitrogen. Mat samples were collected in triplicate at 14 time points between 13:30 h on September 21, 2012 and 11:00 h the following day.</p>For analyses of extracellular metabolites, mat core samples were collected at 03:00, 09:00, 13:00, and 19:00 h (n = 6, each) during the same diel cycle. Once collected, three core samples from each time point were immediately frozen as described above for use as unrinsed controls, while the remaining three samples were transferred to 15 ml Falcon tubes containing 1 ml of spring water that had been filtered through a 0.2 µm filter. Since the 68 °C source pool of Mushroom Spring is lined with mat, in order to avoid metabolites that might have diffused from the mat to overflowing water, we used water from the source pool (92 °C) of chemically similar Octopus Spring (Papke et al., 2003), which is well upstream of photosynthetic mats (maximum range of 72–74 °C). This water did not contain significant levels of any of the organic compounds detected in this study. The re-suspended mat cores were then quickly disrupted on site by vigorous shaking, and the biomass and rinse water were then immediately separated using a centrifuge (16,025 × g for 5 min). The supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube and the rinsed biomass and the rinse water samples were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at -80 °C until further processing. This process did not result in release of metabolites identified in analyses of biomass, suggesting that it did not cause leakage of constituents from intact cells.</p>Ref: </br>[1] Ward D., Tayne T., Anderson K., Bateson M.

All participating patients provided informed consent before taking part in the study. Patients were diagnosed to have cirrhosis on the basis of established clinical, laboratory and/or imaging criteria with ultrasound examination. Cases were suspected to have HCC if they had focal lesion in ultrasound examination and/or elevated AFP above 200 ng/ml, but only diagnosed to have HCC based on well-established diagnostic imaging criteria with spiral CT scanning and/or histopathology examination of liver biopsy. Suspected cases who were not confirmed by CT or biopsy were excluded from both groups of this study. A total of 89 participants were included in this study. The participants consist of 40 HCC cases and 49 patients with liver cirrhosis. Through peripheral venepuncture, single blood sample was drawn into 10 mL BD Vacutainer sterile vacuum tubes without the presence of anticoagulant. The blood was immediately centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The serum supernatant was carefully collected and centrifuged at 2500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. After aliquoting, serum was kept frozen at −80 °C until use. Primary tubes and serum aliquots were labeled using anonymous confidential code numbers with no personal identifiers. Identification codes were cross-referenced with clinical information in a pass code protected computer system. Samples were transported in dried ice.","MTBLS19"
"Extraction","Frozen human serum was thawed at room temperature and 25 μl of serum was mixed with 1.5 ml of 66% ACN containing two internal standards (debrisquinone, 1 μg/ml, for positive mode and nitrobenzoic acid, 10 μg/ml, for negative mode), vortexed and incubated for 10 min on ice. Mixture was then spun at 10 000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant organic solution was transferred, speed-vacuum-dried at room temperature and reconstituted in 50 μl of mobile phase (2% ACN containing 0.1% formic acid) ready for injection.","MTBLS19"
"Chromatography","From each sample, 5 μl was injected onto a reverse-phase 50 × 2.1 mm ACQUITY 1.7-μm C18 column (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) using an ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) with a gradient mobile phase consisting of 2% ACN in water containing 0.1% formic acid (A) and 2% water in ACN containing 0.1% formic acid (B). Each sample was resolved for 10 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The gradient consisted of 100% A for 0.5 min then a ramp of curve 6 to 60% B from 0.5 to 4.0 min, then a ramp of curve 6 to 100% B from 4.0 to 8.0 min, a hold at 100% B until 9.0 min, then a ramp of curve 6 to 100% A from 9.0 to 9.2 min, followed by a hold at 100% A until 10 min.","MTBLS19"
"Mass spectrometry","The column eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer by electrospray. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Q-TOF Premier (Waters) operating in both positive and negative modes. The capillary voltage was set to 3.2 and 3 kV, and the cone voltage of 30 and 20 V, respectively. The desolvation gas flow was set to 800 l/h and the temperature was set to 350 °C. The cone gas flow was 25 l/h, and the source temperature was 120 °C. Accurate mass was maintained by introduction of LockSpray interface of sulfadimethoxine (311.0814 [M + H]+ or 309.0658 [M − H]-) at a concentration of 250 pg/μl in 50% aqueous ACN and a rate of 150 μl/min. UPLC-QTOF data were acquired in centroid mode from 50 to 850 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in MS scanning using the MassLynx software (Waters).","MTBLS19"
"Data transformation","The raw data were converted into Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) format using the MassLynx software (Waters). We used the XCMS package (Scripps Center for Metabolomics, La Jolla, CA) to preprocess each of the eight UPLC-QTOF MS data sets separately. The first step in XCMS is to detect the peaks. The peak detection algorithm first cuts the UPLC-QTOF data into slices, a fraction of a mass unit wide, and then applies a model peak matched filter on those individual slices over the chromatographic time domain. After detecting peaks in individual samples, the peaks are matched across samples to allow calculation of retention time (RT) deviations and relative ion intensity comparison. This is accomplished using a grouping method that uses kernel density estimation to group peaks in the mass domain. These groups are then used to identify and correct drifts in RT from run to run. Following data preprocessing, ion annotation is conducted to identify derivative ions such as isotopes, adducts, and in-source fragments. This helps group ions that are likely to originate from the same metabolite on the basis of their monoisotopic masses and elution profiles. We used the R-package CAMERA for ion annotation.","MTBLS19"
"Metabolite identification","For difference detection, in-house developed MATLAB (Natick, MA) and R scripts are used on the basis of ANOVA statistical models. The ion intensities were first logtransformed to satisfy the normality assumption underlying ANOVA models. On the basis of the experimental design, we took advantage of two-way ANOVA models to combine data sets between batches to increase statistical power. In statistical tests the q-values were estimated based on Storey’s pFDR method. A list of monoisotopic ion masses was obtained for the ions selected by the two-way ANOVA model. Ion annotation information was used to convert the m/z values of annotated isotopes/adducts/neutral-loss fragments ions to the corresponding neutral monoisotopic masses before searching them against the databases. Putative identifications of the monoisotopic masses were found using MetaboSearch to search against four databases: the Human Metabolite DataBase (HMDB), Metlin, Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD), and LIPID MAPS. The mass tolerance in MetaboSearch was set to 10 ppm. Identities of some of the putative metabolite identifications were verified by comparing their MS/MS fragmentation patterns and RT with those of authentic standard compounds. Quantitation of metabolite candidates was performed using isotope dilution technique by UPLC-SRM-MS/MS analysis on the QTRAP 4000 (AB Sciex) instrument. Because of the high physiochemical similarities between the labeled internal standard and the analyte, degradation during sample preparation, variations in instrumental response, and ion suppression effects in LC−ESI−MS can be compensated. Quantitation of metabolites was achieved by correlating their ratio of MS signals detected by SRM in the calibration curves that we constructed by relating the varying amounts of each analyte to their relative response factors (RRFs) as determined by the ratio of the peak area of the analyte to that of the corresponding isotope-labeled internal standard.","MTBLS19"
"Extraction","50 µL of each lithium heparin treated plasma sample was diluted with 150 µL of MeOH [spiked with 4% 13C6-Sorbitol as an extraction internal standard (ISTD)]. The samples were briefly vortexed and placed on ice for 10 mins prior to being centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 5 mins at 4 °C to precipitate any protein present. 100 µL supernatant was separated and transferred into 6 mm diameter conical bottom glass vial inserts that had been placed inside eppendorf vials. An additional 10 µL supernatant from each extracted sample was combined into a separate eppendorf vial, which was vortexed and used to create 5 x 100 µL pooled biological quality control (PBQC) glass vial inserts. Eppendorf vials containing inserts were then dried in vacuo at a temperature of -55 °C and pressure of 3 mbar for 2 hrs. Glass vial inserts were then placed into 2 ml wide top glass vials and covered with metallic crimp caps (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA).

"Data transformation","An Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) was used to analyze the chromatogram. A random PBQC was used for data filtering (to remove background noise), deconvolution (to align peaks and correct for retention time drifts between runs) and peak detection (via characteristics of each ion including m/z ratio, retention time and ion intensity). Using the in house Metabolomics Australia (University of Melbourne, Australia) mass spectra library the mass spectra was then additionally verified by analysis of reference standard compounds.  MassHunter was then used to analyze the relative response ratio for each detected peak (the area of each unique ion) from a randomly selected PBQC, prior to being applied to the remainder of the batch. Overloaded peaks (lactate, glucose, mannose, sucrose, fructose, urea and cholesterol) were analyzed separately from the split mode. Relative response ratio data for each compound detected in each sample was normalized to the ISTD (13C6-Sorbitol). MetaboAnalyst 2.0 was used to generate multivariate analysis pattern analysis models. PCA analysis was performed using the prcomp function. Additional normalization via a generalized log transformation was applied to the data matrix used in order to improve symmetry prior to PC generation. Samples were summarized into scores which are weighted average profiles (loadings) of the original variables.An Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) was used to analyze the chromatogram.

In the negative ion mode, the electrospray voltage was set to -3 kV, and the capillary voltage and tube lens offset were set to -10 and -100 V, respectively; the sheath and auxiliary gas flows (both nitrogen) were 60 and 10 au respectively, and the drying gas temperature was 275 °C.","MTBLS20"
"Data transformation","All raw data were manually inspected using the Qualbrowser module of Xcalibur version 2.0.7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Les Ulis, France), and its chemical formula generator was used to provide elemental compositions. Automatic peak detection and integration were performed using the XCMS software package. Raw files were first of all converted to netCDF format with Xconvert (Thermo Scientific, Les Ulis, France). Data were processed using XCMS version 1.14.126 running under R version 2.8.1. The R language was installed on a Dell Eight-core Intel Xeon 3.00 GHz Processor with 16 Go RAM running Linux (Centos 5.2 x86_64). The matchedFilter algorithm was used and default values were set for all parameters except for “fwhm”, “step”, “steps”, “mzdiff”, “mzwid”, and “minfrac” which were set, respectively, at 4, 0.01, 2, 0.01, 0.01 and 0.5 for both group functions. Grouping of features was performed using CAMERA27 (Collection of Algorithms for MEtabolite pRofile Annotation) software (Bioconductor version 2.8), a free R package. Grouping and annotation were carried out with optimized settings: “sigma” = 6, “perfwhm” = 0.6, “cor_eic_th” = 0.6, “maxcharge” = 2, “maxiso” = 3 and “ppm” = 5. Autocorrelation matrices 28 were generated thanks to a home-made informatics agent.","MTBLS20"
"Metabolite identification","Public database (KEGG, HMDB and Metlin) annotations were performed on datasets resulting from the XCMS process with a home-made informatics agent developed in R language. Annotations were carried out by matching the measured accurate masses ±10 ppm with theoretical ones of public databases.","MTBLS20"
"Sample collection","All culture work was conducted within a Microflow biological safety cabinet and all work areas thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol before use. The cell culture medium utilised in this work was Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and to avoid any bias in this undefined reagent we used a single batch. All DMEM used in this work also originated from a single batch. 1% Penicillin (5000 units/mL) and Streptomycin (50 mg/mL) were used to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth. To ensure sufficient biomass for GC-MS analysis HaCaT cell growth was conducted in 225 cm2 culture flasks utilising standard cell culture procedures. Dithranol was applied when cells were determined by microscopy to be ~90% confluent and then incubated further for 24 h. Dithranol was dissolved in 100% acetone and applied to the cells to give a final concentration range of 0.1-0.5 μg/mL (0.4-2.2 μM) in 0.1 μg/mL steps. In addition to these 5 concentrations a control was used which  involved the application of acetone only at the relevant volume. All drug solutions were made afresh before application to the cells. As shown in Figure 1 all drug exposures plus control were performed in triplicate.  Microscopic inspection was undertaken and no obvious differences in cell confluency or cell structure were observed between the control and drug treated flasks after 24 h and the concentration range of dithranol was comparable with doses that induce minimal apoptosis in highly confluent HaCaT cells.","MTBLS202"
"Extraction","Sample preparation was performed on both the cells as well as the spent culture media (footprint or exometabolome) were analysed. The method for cellular analysis was essentially the same as Teng et al. [Teng Q, Huang WL, Collette TW, Ekman DR, Tan C (2009) A direct cell quenching method for cell-culture based metabolomics. Metabolomics 5 (2):199-208. doi:10.1007/s11306-008-0137-z], but rather than washing with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) we used room temperature PBS (15 mL) in order to reduce temperature shock to the cells. This brief washing took ca. 5 s, after which the cells were quenched and extracted using 100% methanol (7 mL, -48 °C) and detached from the surface by scraping the cells with a disposable cell scraper (Corning, UK). The methanol/cell mixture was thentransferred to a centrifuge tube for extraction. Extraction was aided by three freeze-thaw cycles to liberate as many metabolites as possible. After centrifugation (14°C, 5 min, 16200 g) to pellet the cell debris the supernatant was stored at -80°C. The spent culture media were aspirated from each culture flask and filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size cellulose acetate membrane syringe filter to remove any remaining cellular debris. The filtered metabolic footprint samples were aliquoted (1 mL) into centrifuge tubes and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at -80°C.","MTBLS202"

"Mass spectrometry","The derivatized sample was injected (3µ) split ratio of 10 into a Thermo Electron Trace GC Ultra equipped with amino acid column (Phenomenex; injector temperature = 220°C, helium carrier gas flow rate = 1.1 ml/min). The initial column temperature was 110°C; this was held for 2 min and then increased by 30°C/min to 310°C. The column effluent was introduced into a Trace DSQ quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron; transfer line temperature = 320°C, ion source temperature = 240°C, electron beam = 70 eV). The detector was turned on after a solvent delay of 120 s, and data were collected in full scan mode using 3 scans/s across a mass range of 50–450 m/z.","MTBLS202"
"Data transformation","Samples were analysed in a random order using a Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph and 7683 autosampler (Agilent Technologies, Stockport, UK) coupled to a LECO Pegasus III electron impact time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LECO Corporation, St Joseph, USA).","MTBLS202"
"Metabolite identification","Initial data processing of raw data was undertaken using LECO ChromaTof v2.12 software to construct a data matrix (metabolite peak vs. sample no.) including response ratios (peak area metabolite/peak area succinic-d4 acid internal standard) for each metabolite peak in each sample. Metabolite identifications were assigned through searching and matching against an in-house constructed library and also the NIST02 and Golm metabolome libraries. A definitive match (MSI level 1) means that the retention index and mass spectrum match that of an authentic standard analysed on the same instrument. A putative match (MSI level 2) implies that the mass spectrum can be matched only to a non-Manchester library and cannot be confirmed via an in-house comparison. This process corresponds with the minimum reporting standards proposed for chemical analysis.","MTBLS202"
"Derivatisation","Footprint (200 μL) and fingerprint (1 mL) aliquots (7 mL in total) were spiked with 100 μL internal standard solution (1.32 mg/mL succinic d4 acid, 1.12 mg/mL malonic d2 acid, 1.08 mg/mL glycine d5); vortex mixed and lyophilised overnight (Eppendorf Vacufuge Concentrator 5301, Eppendorf, UK). A two-stage chemical derivatisation was performed on the dried sample, 80 μL of 20 mg/mL O-methylhydroxylamine solution was added and heated at 40°C for 90 min followed by addition of 80 μL MSTFA (N-acetyl-N-[trimethylsilyl]-trifluoroacetamide) and heating at 40°C for 90 min. 20 μL of a retention index solution(4 mg/mL n-decane, n-dodecane, n-pentadecane, n-nonadecane, n-docosane dissolved in hexane) was added.","MTBLS202"

"Mass spectrometry","Eluted compounds were detected by a high-resolution MicroToF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization source operating in positive ionization mode. Typical instrument settings were as follows: capillary voltage 4500 V, capillary exit 130 V, dry gas temperature 200°C, dry gas flow of 8 L/min. Ions were detected from m/z 50 to 1400 at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. Mass calibration was performed using sodium formate clusters (10 mM solution of NaOH in 50/50% v/v isopropanol/water containing 0.2% formic acid). idMS/MS datasets were acquired by operating the instrument with an isolation mass 400 Da, an isolation width 300 Da (largest width meaning all mass is accessible) and collision energies set either to 20, 30, 40, 50ev to cover broad range mass signal fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation (CID). idMS/MS data collection was restricted to ten samples that were initially selected based on the high range of chemical variations within the total sample population that these samples captured. Four microliters of each of these samples were first analyzed by UHPLC-ESI/qTOF-MS in profile mode (single MS approach, collision energy of 0 ev) using the aforementioned chromatographic conditions with the objective of identifying compound precursors later on associated with molecular fragments as well as of inferring fragmentation patterns due to in-source collision during ionization (low cone voltage settings). The same samples were then analyzed for idMS/MS data acquisition at 4 different collision energy conditions (20, 30, 40 and 50ev) separately with all detectable mass signals being equally considered as dissociation targets. This resulted into one MS profile dataset (MS1) and 4 CID-derived MS/MS datasets that were then rapidly aligned and post-processed using open source programs.","MTBLS203"

"Extraction","At the incubation site 1 mL cell suspensions were injected into 1 mL of -70 °C cold quenching solution composed of 70 % methanol in water using a thermo block above dry ice. Centrifuge tubes containing the solution during harvest were cooled in a pre-chilled cooling box to keep sample temperature below -20 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 16,100 rcf for 2 min with the centrifuge and rotor cooled at -20 °C. Supernatant was decanted and residual liquid carefully removed. The pellet was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized at -50 °C in a 2 mL round bottom Eppendorf tube. Lyophilized cells were disrupted using the ball mill MM 301 (Retsch GmbH & Co., Germany) in two variants for 3 minutes: (a) using 0.5 ml of glass beads (500 μm i.d., Sigma, St.Louis MO) concomitant with 0.5 ml extraction solvent and (b) using a single 5 mm i.d. steel ball, followed by the addition of 0.5 mL extraction solvent and vortexing. After 2 min centrifugation at 16,100 rcf, the supernatants were removed (200 μl for the glass bead method, 350 μl for the steel ball method) followed by a secondary extraction step using an additional 800 μl extraction solvent, centrifugation and adding the supernatant (700 μl for the glass bead method) to the first aliquot. Hence, for both methods the same fraction of extraction solvent was used (70% of total extraction volume). Five different extraction solvent system (methanol:isopropanol:water (5:2:2)) was used. Extracts were concentrated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Dried extracts were kept at -80 °C for up to 4 weeks before derivatization and analysis by GC-TOF mass spectrometry.","MTBLS208"
"Chromatography","A mixture of internal retention index markers was prepared using fatty acid methyl esters of C8, C9, C10, C12, C14, C16, C18, C20, C22, C24, C26, C28 and C30 linear chain length, dissolved in chloroform at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml (C8-C16) and 0.4 mg/ml (C18-C30). 2 μl of this RI mixture were added to the dried extracts. 5 μl of a solution of 20 mg/ml of 98% pure methoxyamine hydrochloride (CAS No. 593-56-6, Sigma, St.Louis MO) in pyridine (silylation grade, Pierce, Rockford IL) was added and shaken at 30 °C for 90 min to protect aldehyde and ketone groups. 45 μl of MSTFA.1%TMCS (1 ml bottles, Pierce, Rockford IL) was added for trimethylsilylation of acidic protons and shaken at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction mixtures were transferred to 2 ml clear glass autosampler vials with microinserts (Agilent, Santa Clara CA) and closed by 11 mm T/S/T crimp caps (MicroLiter, Suwanee GA).1 μl sample was filled using 39 mm vial penetration at 1 μl/s fill speed, injecting 0.5 μl at 10 μl/s injection speed at initial 50 °C which was ramped by 12 °C/s to final 250 °C and hold for 3 minutes. The injector was operated in splitless mode, opening the split vent after 25 s.A 30 m long, 0.25 mm i.d. Rtx-5Sil MS column with 0.25 μm 95% dimethyl 5% diphenyl polysiloxane film and additional 10 m integrated guard column was used (Restek, Bellefonte PA).","MTBLS208"
"Mass spectrometry","A Leco Pegasus 4D time of flight mass spectrometer was controlled by the Leco ChromaTOF.Electron impact ionization at 70V was employed with an ion source temperature of 250 °C.After 290 s solvent delay, filament 1 was turned on and mass spectra were acquired at mass resolving power R = 600 from m/z 85–500 at 10 spectra s-1 and 1800 V detector voltage without turning on the mass defect option. Recording ended after 1200 s. The instrument performed autotuning for mass calibration using FC43 (Perfluorotributylamine) before starting analysis sequences.","MTBLS208"
"Data transformation","Files were preprocessed directly after data acquisition and stored as ChromaTOF-specific *.peg files. ChromaTOF was used for data preprocessing without smoothing, 3 s peak width, baseline subtraction just above the noise level, and automatic mass spectral deconvolution and peak detection at signal/noise levels of 10:1 throughout the chromatogram.","MTBLS208"
"Metabolite identification","The LECO/Fiehn metabolomics library was used to identify compounds. Each compound was assigned a similarity value, a measurement of the similarity of the collected spectrum with the library mass spectrum, with an assignment cut-off value of 70 %.Primary metabolite data analysis was performed using ChromaTOF software. Version 4.43.3.0, which supports automatic deconvolution of all mass spectra from a chromatogram, built in mass-spectral correction for co-eluting metabolites, calculation of retention indices, and identification of a suitable fragment mass-to charge ratio for selective quantification. In the Statistical Compare feature of the ChromaTOF, the processed samples were added to a sample table, and assigned to their respective groups. The compounds were then aligned based on similarities in both retention time and mass spectral match.","MTBLS208"
"Sample collection","The cell-wall deficient mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-400 cw15 mt+, was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Resource Center at the University of Minnesota (St. Paul, MN, USA). The cells were cultured in Tris acetate phosphate (TAP) medium containing 5 mM ammonium chloride as N source at 22 °C under constant illumination with cool-white fluorescent bulbs at an illumination of 80 μmol photons m-2 s-1 and with continuous shaking at 150 rpm. Single colonies were used to inoculate a pre-culture in a shake flask plugged with a sponge to allow aeration. This culture was harvested at mid-exponential phase and used to inoculate a new culture at a starting density of around 0.1 O.D750, which corresponds to a cell dry weight of 0.05 mg ml-1. The cells were cultured continuously in a volume of 1 L in a 5 L conical flask by serial dilution, not allowing the cell density to exceed 0.4 O.D750. The cells were adapted to this environment by at least three serial dilutions corresponding to more than 5 doublings. The culture volume was always equal to or less than one fifth of the flask. This along with the low cell density ensured that the cultures had consistent illumination without significant shading and that the cells remain in a metabolic steady state (confirmed by steady state 13C labelling patterns).After the cells had been adapted to the above conditions, the culture was split in two and harvested by centrifugation (5000×g for 2 minutes). One half of the centrifuged cells were washed with acetate-free TAP media and re-suspended in 2 L of fresh TAP media (containing acetate). The remaining cells were washed with acetate free Tris phosphate media without nitrogen source (N-) and re-suspended in 2 L TAP media (with acetate, without N). The cells from each treatment were divided into seven 1 L conical flasks with a culture volume of 200 mL and then allowed to grow under the same conditions described above. The culture was divided into four 50 mL conical tubes and centrifuged immediately at 5000×g for 2 min at 0 ºC for the zero hour time point. Three of the centrifuged pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 ºC. The total time from harvest to freezing took less than 10 minutes. One of the stored pellets was shipped on dry ice for metabolite analysis and another was shipped on dry ice for proteomic analysis. To the fourth pellet, 1 mL of the RNA stabilization reagent, RNAlater (Ambion Life Technologies), was added and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -70 ºC. This sample was sent on dry ice for transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq. The seven flasks being grown simultaneously were harvested successively after 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h. The culturing and collection process was repeated on four separate occasions (different weeks), to yield four biological replicates. The amount of cells harvested per sample was always more than 4 mg dry weight equivalent.","MTBLS208"
"Sample collection","In a 3-year study from 2004 to 2006, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Triso) and 13 associated weed species were exposed in a chamberless mini-FACE system. The field site contains 15 circular field plots (2 m diameter) and is located at Heidfeldhof, a farm managed by the Plant Breeding Station of the University of Hohenheim (9 Degrees 11 minutes E, 48 Degrees 42 Minutes N, 395 m asl), south of Stuttgart (Germany).</p>In each of the 3 years, the plots with local soil (slightly stagnic luvisol) were manually dug to a depth of 30 cm at the end of March. Wheat as the main crop was sown in lines at a spacing of 15 cm, seed distance of 1.5 cm and depth of 2 cm to a density of 200 plants/sqm. Based on agronomic practice recommended for spring wheat, the plots were fertilised with 140 kg nitrogen (N)/ha, 30 kg phosphorus (P)/ha and 60 kg potassium (K)/ha at 50 / 25 / 25% at different development stages of the plants (EC 13–29, EC 30–39 and EC 40–59; [1]). In addition, on EC 30–39, a trace element fertiliser was applied containing 0.03 kg boron (B) /ha, 0.45 kg magnesium (Mg)/ha, 0.36 kg sulphur (S)/ha and 0.03 kg manganese (Mn)/ha. Soil moisture was measured using time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors (IMKO, Ettlingen, Germany). Plots were manually irrigated, if necessary, with the same amount of water applied to all treatments. Irrigation volumes were noted and taken into account for calculation of total water supply, including precipitation amounts.</p>The CO2 exposure involved three treatments with five replicates each: (i) CONTROL plots with ambient air CO2 concentration without technical equipment, (ii) AMBIENT plots with ambient air CO2 concentration and the frame system (AMB), and (iii) FACE plots with elevated CO2 concentration and the frame system (ELE). The exposure started before seed emergence and continued until final harvest. To achieve a target gas concentration of 150 µl/l above AMBIENT (24 hr average), pure CO2 was released directly into the plant canopy through an injection system and regulated according to wind direction and velocity to maintain the set concentration. The CO2 concentrations achieved at canopy height were monitored in the centre of each field plot. Additional information on the performance of the system is given elsewhere ([2][3][4]).</p>Wheat plants from the central square metre of each plot were harvested at crop maturity and separated into leaves, stems and ears. Dry weights (DW) of the different biomass fractions were determined after drying until constant weight (leaf and stem at 60 ºC, ear at room temperature). Ear numbers were counted and grains were extracted from the ears. Total grain weights were measured and thousand grain weights (TGW) were determined using a seed counter (Condator ""E"", Pfeuffer, Winnenden, Germany). Grains were further separated into size classes (>2.8; 2.8e2.5; 2.5e2.2; <2.2 mm) using a Sortimat (Type K, Pfeuffer, Winnenden, Germany).</p>Ref:</br>[1] Tottman D.R.

"Extraction","A proportion of wheat grains were ground into a fine powder using a laboratory mill (MM 301, Retsch, Haan, Germany) directly before analysis. Duplicate aliquots of the wheat flour (10-20 mg) were homogenised in 1 ml of 80% methanol, containing 10 µM ribitol as internal standard (IS). The metabolite extracts were agitated three times at 6.5 m/s for 45 s in a Precellys Homogenizer (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) using 1 mm zirconia beads (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). After centrifugation (15 000 x g, room temperature, 20 min), 750 µl supernatant was transferred to a 1 ml glass vial (Supelco, Bellfonte, USA) and dried under N.

For chromatographic separation, a RTx-5ms capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, with 0.25 mm coating; Restek, Bellefonte, USA) was used. Helium was applied as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The transferline was set to 250 °C and the ion source temperature was 200 °C. After being held at 80 °C for 2 min, the oven temperaturewas increased to 325 °C in steps of 5 °C/min and held at this temperature for 2 min. The system was equilibrated at 80 °C for 2 min prior to injection of the next sample.","MTBLS21"

"Data transformation","Raw data files were converted to netCDF/ANDI-MS format usign the Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) export function. Converted files were then uploaded to MeltDB (https://meltdb.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de) into an experiment consisting of four chromatogram groups for harvest years 2005 and 2006 with ambient (AMB) and elevated (ELE) CO2. In order to assess the grouping performance, we performed a peak detection with XCMS [1], using the matched filter method with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 and full-width at half height of 5 in order to find well represented peaks. The peak finding step reported between 410 and 465 peaks per chromatogram. The apex scan indices for each chromatogram's peaks were stored in one tab separated value file for each chromatogram. We chose signals as reported from the Data Transformation/Peak Finding step within a retention time window of +/- 30 s. To be counted as a complete group, the scans corresponding to the tags were required to have a pairwise cosine similarity between their binned mass spectra of >0.99 throughout all chromatograms and a maximum mass deviation of 0.01 Dalton. The selection process lead to 184 peak groups containing peaks appearing in all chromatograms, which defined our ground truth for the evaluation of the multiple alignments produced by our methods.

A centrifuge was pre-chilled to -9 °C for at least 1 h and the metal fixed angle centrifuge rotor was frozen at -20 °C for 1 h to ensure rapid quenching of cells. 1.6 ml quenching solution (60:40 HPLC grade MeOH:H2O (Sigma-Aldrich)) per flask was added to pre-weighed 2 ml tubes and left on dry ice for 15 min to cool to approximately -40 °C. Cells were scraped into the flask media with minimum disruption and the cell suspension was transferred to a 15 ml tube for centrifugation at room temperature for 5 min at 1000 x g. 500 µl cell suspension was retained for DNA extraction. Supernatant was removed by pouring and cell pellets were resuspended in residual media by gently pipetting. 200 µl of this cell suspension was added to 1.6 ml quenching solution at -40 °C and mixed immediately by inversion. Samples were centrifuged in the pre-chilled rotor at -9 °C, 2500 x g  for 5 min. A maximum of 10 samples were processed at a time to ensure all were kept below 0 °C. Quenching solution was removed using a glass Pasteur pipette and the tube was weighed to estimate cell mass before being frozen at -80 °C until extraction.","MTBLS210"
"Extraction","HPLC grade MeOH (EMD Millipore), H2O and chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) were cooled on ice and 8 µl/mg pellet mass MeOH and 7.2 µl/mg H2O added to each sample tube. Tubes were vortexed for 30 s and returned to ice. 8 µl/mg chloroform were added to 1.9 ml glass vials and after pulse vortexing, the pellet and MeOH/H2O mixture were transferred using a glass Pasteur pipette. Samples were vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 1500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Biphasic samples were left at room temperature for 5 min before the upper layer containing polar metabolites was removed using a Hamilton syringe. 270 µl of non-polar lipid-containing lower layer were then transferred to a 1.8 ml glass tube and stored overnight at -80 °C. 7 Aa23-T samples and 6 samples from each infected line were taken forward. 40 µl was removed to combine for a quality control (QC) sample before all samples were dried under nitrogen, taken back up in 270 µl chloroform and stored at -80 °C until use.","MTBLS210"

Hansen, Horsholm, Denmark), C. zemplinina (Institute of Wine Biotechnology (IWBT)-Y1082) and K. aerobia (IWBT-Y845) were used to ferment the grape must. 11 l stainless steel fermentation vessels containing 10 l of must were inoculated with 10^6 cfu/ml of yeast. Fermentations were carried out in triplicate at 15 °C. The non-Saccharomyces yeasts were allowed to ferment until approximately 2% ethanol concentration was reached. At this point, S. cerevisiae was added at 10^6 cfu/mL concentration to finish the fermentations. The final wines were bottled after clarification via cold rest for one week at -4 °C in 750 ml glass bottles with screw caps. Wines were then transported to the laboratory of the Department of Food Quality and Nutrition, Research and Innovation Center, Fondazione Edmund Mach (FEM) for chemical analysis.","MTBLS212"
"Extraction","A divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) coating 50/30 μm, 2 cm length Solid-Phase-Micro-Extraction (SPME) fibre was used for wine volatile extraction. Vials were prepared as follows. 5 ml of wine and 50 μl of 0.5 mg/l 2-octanol were added to 20 ml screw cap vials containing 1.5 g NaCl. A Gerstel MPS autosampler (GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG) equipped with the standard sample agitator and a SPME fibre conditioning station was used to extract the volatiles from the sample vial headspace. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 35 °C under 500 rpm rotation at 10 s intervals. Extraction took place at 10 s, 5 min, and 30 min, prior to desorption in the inlet for 180 s at 250 °C. Quality control (QC) vials consisting of an equal mix of all samples were spaced at the beginning and every third sample thereafter.","MTBLS212"
"Chromatography","GC×GC-TOF-MS analysis of the extracts was performed using a LECO Pegasus-4D system consisting of an Agilent 6890N (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a LECO Pegasus 4D detector. The system employed a consumables free modulation system. Helium carrier gas was used with a flow set at 1.2 mL/min and a splitless time of 180sec. The oven was equipped with a 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm VF-WAX MS primary column (Agilent Technologies) and a 1.5 m x 0.15 mm x 0.15 μm RXI 17Sil MS secondary column (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA).

There was an acquisition delay of 120 s.","MTBLS212"
"Data transformation","ChromaTOF software version 4.32 was used to perform baseline correction, deconvolution and peak picking of the raw data. The baseline offset was set to 1, just above the noise level. The first dimension peak width was set to 43 s while the second dimension peak width was set to 0.1 s. A factor of 500 was set as the match required to combine peaks in the second dimension. A signal to noise (S/N) of 10 was used for the 10 s and 5 min extraction times data with a minimum S/N of 6 for sub peak retention. A S/N of 100 was used for the 30 min extraction time data with a minimum S/N of 60 for sub peak retention. Traditional integration was used. Forward library searching was used with the following parameters: Hits to return were set to 10, minimum molecular weight was set to 40, maximum molecular weight was set to 350, the mass threshold was set to 50 and the minimum similarity match was set to 700. The NIST and Wiley libraries were used. For alignment the following parameters were used: a mass threshold of 10, a minimum similarity match of 600, the maximum number of modulation periods matching peaks could be apart was set to 1, a maximum retention time difference was set to 7 s, for peaks not found by initial peak finding the signal to noise ratio was set to 5 for the 10 s and 5 min extractions and to 50 for the 30 min extractions, for analytes to be kept they had to be found in all biological replicates within a class. Each yeast species was given its own class.","MTBLS212"

"Extraction","The culture medium was removed from cells and the dishes were placed on top of dry ice. Cells were scraped immediately and metabolites extracted into the extraction solvent by adding 2 ml of a cold mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v). The resulting suspension was bath sonicated for 3 minutes, and 2 ml of cold water was added. Then, 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) was added to the samples and bath sonicated for 3 minutes. Cell lysates were centrifuged (5000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C) and the aqueous phase was carefully transferred into a new tube. The sample was frozen, lyophilized and stored at -80 °C until further analysis.","MTBLS213"
"Chromatography","LC/MS analyses were performed using an UHPLC system (1290 series, Agilent Technologies) coupled to a 6550 ESIQTOF MS (Agilent Technologies) operated in negative (ESI) electrospray ionization mode. Vials containing extracted metabolites were kept at -20 °C prior to LC/MS analysis. Metabolites were separated using an Acquity UPLC (BEH) C18 RP column (2.1 x 150 mm, 1.7 µm) and the solvent system was A2 = 1 mM ammonium fluoride in water and B2 = acetonitrile, as previously reported.

The treatment conditions were as follows: control – unadjusted KFSM media at 277 mOsm/, T1 and T2 – KFSM media adjusted to 377 mOsm/L 477 and mOsm/L respectively. Each hyperosmotic medium was prepared by the addition of 2 M NaCl prepared in PBS to commercial KFSM. Osmolarity measurements were performed using a vapour pressure osmometer (Vapro, Wescor Inc).","MTBLS214"
"Extraction","Five sets of cells were grown in 6-well plates and treated with control, T1 and T2 treatment media. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS (4°C) and lysed by the addition of 1.5 mL of methanol maintained at −80°C. Plates were scraped over a dry ice bath, and each lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Lysates were vortex-mixed at 1200 rpm for 5 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 g (4°C). The supernatants were concentrated in a vacuum concentrator and freeze-dried subsequently. ","MTBLS214"
"Chromatography","Analysis was performed on a Prominence UFLC system (Shimadzu) coupled to a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex). A Waters T3 C18 2.1 × 100 mm, 3 μm column (Waters) was used for separation. Each sample was reconstituted in 50 µL of water and 10 µL was injected for each analysis in positive and negative ionization mode. The mobile phase for positive ionization mode was 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water (eluent A) and 0.1% FA in acetonitrile (eluent B). The gradient profile was 2% B from 0 to 2 min, 15% B at 8 min, 50% B at 14 min, 90% B from 18 to 20.5 min, and 2% B from 21 to 27 min. The mobile phase for negative ionization mode was 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.05% FA in water (eluent A) and 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.05% FA in 9:1 acetonitrile/water (eluent B). The gradient profile was 2% B from 0 to 2 min, 15% B at 8 min, 50% B at 14 min, 100% B from 18 to 20.5 min, and 2% B from 21 to 27 min. The flow rate in both chromatographic methods was 0.3 mL/min. ","MTBLS214"
"Mass spectrometry","Acquisition of MS/MS spectra in both ionization modes was controlled by the information-dependent-acquisition (IDA) function of the Analyst TF software (AB Sciex). One TOF MS survey scan (150 ms) was followed by 25 MS/MS scans (50 ms each). The mass range TOF-MS and MS/MS were 50–1000 and 25–1000 m/z respectively. The following parameters were applied: dynamic background subtraction, charge monitoring to exclude multiply charged ions and isotopes, and dynamic exclusion of former target ions for 5 s. Collision energy (CE) was ramped from 20–30V in MS/MS scans.","MTBLS214"
"Data transformation","MarkerView (AB Sciex) was used for peak detection and alignment of raw chromatographic data obtained from acquisition in positive and negative ionization mode respectively. One peak table comprising the mass to charge ratio (m/z), retention time (RT) and integrated peak area of detected peaks in the analyzed samples was generated for each ionization mode. The following peak classes were excluded from subsequent analysis: i) peaks attributed to isotopes, ii) peaks with an average area that were less than 3 times the average area in blank injections and iii) peaks with a coefficient of variation greater than 80% among replicates. The samples in each peak table were normalized to their respective 90th percentile peak area sums.","MTBLS214"
"Metabolite identification","The m/z values of each marker peak were queried in the METLIN metabolite database25 to obtain its putative metabolite identifications. For this step, the batch search mode was adopted, with mass accuracy set to 12 ppm. The following adducts were applied to the m/z values of marker peaks obtained via positive ionization mode: [M+H]+, [M+NH4]+ [M+Na]+, [M+K]+, [M−H2O+H]+. Similarly, [M−H]−, [M−H2O−H]−, [M+Cl]−, [M+FA−H]− were applied to m/z values obtained via the negative ionization mode. Metabolite identities were confirmed by retrieval of experimental MS/MS spectra and comparison with the respective entries in METLIN or MassBank spectra databases. Selected metabolites were verified with standards. Unresolved metabolites with the same molecular formula were reported as mixtures.","MTBLS214"

Then, 80 µl N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA; Sigma-Aldrich; 394866) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C.","MTBLS215"
"Chromatography","GC/MS measurements were carried out on a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (AccuTOF GCv 4G; JEOL, Akishima, Japan) equipped with a 7890A GC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Typical column, injector settings, and temperature programs were as follows. The injection volume was 1 µl (splitless) in EI mode. In FI mode, 2 µl was injected using splitless mode unless otherwise stated. The injector temperature was set at 230 °C. GC separation was performed on a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies) with a carrier gas (He) flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The oven temperature gradient for the derivatized standard saccharides was as follows. After a 4 min, 70 °C isotherm period, the oven was programmed to rise to 325 °C at a rate of 35 °C/min, then held at 325 °C for 1 min. The temperature of the GC/MS transfer line was set at 250 °C.","MTBLS215"
"Mass spectrometry","An EI/FI combination ion source was used with the JEOL AccuTOF GCv 4G GC/oaTOFMS system, which has been partially updated from the prototype described previously in [1] The ion source temperature was set at a value in the range of 130–250 °C for EI, and 70–220 °C for FI. Unless otherwise stated, EI voltage and current were 70 V with 300 µA and 18 V with 100 µA, respectively. For FI measurements, carbon emitters purchased from CARBOTEC (Bonn, Germany) were used; the emitter (CARBOTEC FI) consists of a 5 µm tungsten wire with a carbon microneedle coating, max current on which is 11.5 mA. Cathode voltage for FI was set at –l0 kV. The emitter was refreshed with a 10 mA flush current for 30 ms in every 400 ms spectral data acquisition cycle as described previously [1]. Each emitter could be used for 80 repeated injections, at least, without any visible sign of degradation in spectral patterns or increased background signals. The recording m/z range was 10–1600 in all ionization modes. Typical pressures in the ion source and mass analyzer were on the order of 10–4 Pa and 10–5 Pa, respectively, for both EI and FI modes. The micro-channel plate detector voltage was set at 1700 V for regular EI mode, 2100 V for low-voltage (18 V) EI mode, and 2100 V for FI mode. The detector gain differences (peak intensity enhancement) between each voltage setting were 12.7 times (from 1700 V to 1850 V) and 125 times (from 1700 V to 2100 V), respectively.","MTBLS215"

"Metabolite identification","To evaluate the reproducibility of the derivatization procedure and sensitivity of each ionization mode, glucose standard solutions were aliquoted and dried down in microtubes to make test samples that contain 5 nmol, 10 nmol, 50 nmol, 100 nmol, 500 nmol, 1 µmol, 5 µmol, 10 µmol, and 50 µmol of glucose per tube (three tubes each). The test samples were derivatized by using the above-mentioned protocol, and 1 µl (out of 100 µl) from each tube was subjected to GC/MS analysis with each ionization mode. The peak areas (N = 3 for each concentration) of conventional EI-mode extracted ion chromatogram (EIC, m/z 319.2) showed good linearity (R2 = 0.9991) in sample concentrations from 50 pmol/µl (the lowest concentration tested) to 5 nmol/µl (the highest concentration that gave no detector saturation). The peak areas of FI-mode EIC (m/z 569.3) showed good linearity (R2 = 0.9987) from 5 nmol/µl (the lowest concentration that gave good signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)) up to 100 nmol/µl (linearity lost above this concentration).","MTBLS215"

"Data transformation","Raw data was converted into an mzXML file format using ReadW (v4.0.2). The scans from negative and positive electrospray ionization were saved in two different files. Untargeted analysis for both ionization methods was done by using the open source R package XCMS44. XCMS parameters were optimized by the R-package IPO45. XCMS-data processing results in a data matrix which contains peak intensities (AUCs) from the negative and positive ionization mode. The peak intensities are called metabolic features, which are a unique combination of retention-time and median m/z ratio.</p>The order of the serum samples was randomized for analysis to avoid time-dependent bias. To exclude system-peaks (impurities in the measurement-system, visible in blanks) as well as poorly detected metabolic features, filter steps were performed based on QCs and BLs. A quantile regression approach was applied to correct time-dependent drifts, based on QC-intensities. Therefore, the R-function quant.reg was applied in two steps to achieve the requested drift correction 46,47. First based on the QC-intensities a model was built to configure the variation in time. The 50% quantile of the QC’s (y’s) was estimated via nonparametric quantile regression, using regression splines depending on the sample number (x’s). This procedure fit a piecewise cubic polynomial (breakpoints in the third derivative) with 16 knots (df) arranged at the 50% quantile of the x’s: rq (y ~ bs ( x, df = 16), tau = 0.5). Second, another quantile regression model was estimated to attune all samples using a multiplicative correction factor based on the median intensities of the original QC-intensities. After a successful drift correction, metabolic features were used for statistical analysis.","MTBLS218"

"Metabolite identification","Date output from instrument was first analyzed with ChromaTOF (LECO, St. Joseph, MI) to determine baseline, peak area, and peak identities. Software settings included a baseline offset of 0.5, automatic smoothing, 1st dimension peak width of 24 s, 2nd dimension peak width of 0.25 s, and a match of 700 was required to combine peaks with a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) of 10 for all subpeaks. Peaks were required to have a S/N of 100 and a minimum similarity score of 800 before assigning a name. Unique mass was used for peak area calculation.</p>To align the samples, MetPP (http://metaopen.sourceforge.net/metpp.html) was used, along with the extraction blank file used for peak deduction. Unknowns were retained during peak alignment. On-the-fly alignment was used with quality control samples manually selected as the peak list for primary alignment. Peak alignment was performed using the default criteria.</p>After alignment, further processing of the data was done to remove any batch effects from the data set using LOESS. To remove analytes that were not reproducibly detected, analytes for which more than half of the values were missing in the QC samples or for which the QC samples had a coefficient of variance larger than 0.5 were removed from the data set. Then, missing values were manually corrected using small value correction only if more than half of the values in biological replicates were missing. (However, we note that for the OVCAR-3 validation experiments, since only one metabolite was being tested and there were very few samples, direct results from ChromaTOF were used because the downstream analysis steps were either unnecessary or inappropriate.) </p>Annotated analytes were then compared to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB); if they were listed in KEGG and HMDB they were considered annotated as metabolites. The metabolites were then verified by a manual confirmation of similarity between the annotated peak spectrum and the library spectrum.","MTBLS226"

"Metabolite identification","Metabolite identification was performed using identification module of Dynamet software. To match features to data base, monoisotopic masses of features are calculated from possible adducts mass shifts. In case of successful adduct grouping the assigned monoisotopic mass is used to search for masses in database within user defined maximal deviation whereby matches are further restricted by estimation of metabolites possible number of carbon atoms. We estimated the number of carbon atoms from mass isotopologue pattern of natural labeled, and if provided, from a mixture of natural labeled and uniformly 13C labeled cell extract. As a general restriction the range of the possible number of carbon atoms is calculated for each metabolite, whereby the lower limit is defined by the number of 13C related mass isotopologues grouped per feature and the upper limit by the compound with similar mass present in the Pubchem database containing most number of carbon atoms. Depending on the consistency and reliability of the results obtained by applied estimation methods, each estimation gets a quality score (q-score) ranging from 0 to 15, and best scored estimation is selected. For the current study the KEGG database was used.</p>For each compound in each sample we determined the summed number of labeled Carbon atoms:</br>n_13C=(f_M0 * f_M1*1 + f_Mn *n)</br>where n is number of C atoms, f_Mi is f_Mi=A_Mi/A_tot and A_Mi is ith isotopologue of metabolite i, A_tot is summed area of all isotopologues, A_tot=summed area of all isotopologue of a feauture where m is the metabolites number of carbon atoms.</br>","MTBLS228"

All further Processing was performed with DynaMet app, an extension package from emzed (installation can be found at http://emzed.ethz.ch/installation.html). After installation of emzed, DynaMet can be directly installed by typing following command in the IPython console: !pip install dynamet. An overview of all processing steps is shown in the file 'Data Transformation Protocol.txt' which is available in the study folder.","MTBLS229"
"Metabolite identification","Metabolite identification was performed using identification module of Dynamet software. To match features to data base, monoisotopic masses of features are calculated from possible adducts mass shifts. In case of successful adduct grouping the assigned monoisotopic mass is used to search for masses in database within user defined maximal deviation whereby matches are further restricted by estimation of metabolites possible number of carbon atoms. We estimated the number of carbon atoms from mass isotopologue pattern of natural labeled, and if provided, from a mixture of natural labeled and uniformly 13C labeled cell extract. As a general restriction the range of the possible number of carbon atoms is calculated for each metabolite, whereby the lower limit is defined by the number of 13C related mass isotopologues grouped per feature and the upper limit by the compound with similar mass present in the Pubchem database containing most number of carbon atoms. Depending on the consistency and reliability of the results obtained by applied estimation methods, each estimation gets a quality score (q-score) ranging from 0 to 15, and best scored estimation is selected. For the current study the KEGG database was used.</p>For each compound in each sample we determined the summed number of labeled Carbon atoms:</br>n_13C=(f_M0 * f_M1*1 + f_Mn *n)</br>where n is number of C atoms, f_Mi is f_Mi=A_Mi/A_tot and A_Mi is ith isotopologue of metabolite i, A_tot is summed area of all isotopologues, A_tot=summed area of all isotopologue of a feauture where m is the metabolites number of carbon atoms.</br>","MTBLS229"
"Sample collection","Macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells) were seeded at a density of 3.0E6 cells in 150 mm dishes using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, then grown for 2 days and stimulated for 24 hours with 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide diluted in fresh medium. A control culture was run in parallel by incubating for the same period of time with fresh medium only. Three biological replicates were performed per condition, and two dishes were used for each replicate. After stimulation, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s PBS, scraped out and harvested into 15-ml centrifuge tubes.","MTBLS23"
"Extraction","Cell suspensions were softly centrifuged (230 × g for 5 min) and as much buffer as possible was removed. Then, 170 µl of 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to the cell pellet and the cell suspensions were transferred to 2 ml micro-centrifuge tubes for extraction. Subsequently, the water soluble metabolites were extracted with four volumes of chilled (-20 °C) chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). After vortexing, the samples were centrifuged (12,000 × g for 5 min) and the upper (aqueous) layers containing water-soluble metabolites were transferred into glass vials, followed by drying in a vacuum concentrator.</p>Metabolite extracts were evaporated to dryness using a vacuum concentrator. For chemical derivatization, 30 µl of methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg/ml) were added to each sample, followed by incubation at 37 ºC with shaking for 90 min to protect carbonyl groups. Next, 120 µl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were added to each vial, followed by incubation at 37 ºC with shaking for 30 min to derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups. The samples were then allowed to cool to room temperature prior to analysis by GC-MS.","MTBLS23"
"Chromatography","Chromatography was carried out on an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph using the manufacturer's software (Chemstation) and a HP-5MS gas chromatography column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA; 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness).","MTBLS23"
"Mass spectrometry","Samples were analyzed in duplicate using an Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using a HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies). One microliter of each sample was injected in splitless mode and with the port temperature held at 250 °C throughout analysis. The GC oven was initially maintained at 60 °C for 1 min and then ramped to 325 °C by 10 °C/min and kept at this final temperature for 5 min to complete an analysis cycle.","MTBLS23"
"Data transformation","After converting raw data to netCDF format, the data were processed by the MetaboliteDetector software for peak deconvolution and chromatographic alignment. Retention indices (RI) were calculated based on the analysis of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (C8 - C30) (Agilent Technologies) as external retention time standards, then their retention index information was subsequently applied to all experimental chromatograms for retention time alignment. MetaboliteDetector parameters for peak detection and deconvolution are as follows: Peak threshold, 7; minimum peak height, 7; deconvolution width, 8.","MTBLS23"
"Metabolite identification","Deconvoluted features were identified by matching to the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked Library, which contains mass spectral and retention indix information for approximately 700 metabolites. Each initial match to the library was manually inspected to confirm a confident identification. The data were also matched against the NIST 08 library to identify additional peaks not included in the Fiehn library. MetaboliteDetector software was used for database matching and batch identification/quantification parameters are as follows: required score, 0.6; ΔRI, 25; minimum S/N, 20; maximum peak discrepancy index, 100. Ions 73 and 143 were excluded from use as metabolite quantification ions, since these are due to fragmentation of the trimethylsilyl groups. Otherwise, three unique fragment ions were assigned to each metabolite for quantification and used for each individual GC-MS analysis when processing the data in batch mode. The summed areas of the three quantification ions were exported from MetaboliteDetector and used in further statistical anayses. All identifications were manually validated by inspection of retention index and spectrum matches.","MTBLS23"

"Extraction","Frozen EDTA plasma was thawed on ice and vortex-mixed for 30 s prior to treatment. The protein precipitation extraction was performed by adding cold acetonitrile (1 ml) to a plasma volume (250 µl). After the organic solvent had been added, the samples were vortex-mixed for 30 s at room temperature and centrifuged at 15,294 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. The dried samples were reconstituted in 50 µl of the different experimental standard solutions.","MTBLS234"
"Chromatography","Sample analysis was performed using a Waters Aquity ultra-high-performance LC system coupled to a Synapt HDMS oa-Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA). The gradient chromatographic separation was performed with a C18 Vision HT-HL ultra-high-performance LC column (2 x 150 mm, 1.5 µm, Alltech Grom GmbH, Rottenburg-Hailfingen, Germany). Elution buffer A was water containing 0.1% formic acid, and elution buffer B was acetonitrile. The flow rate was set at 0.300 ml/min. The linear-gradient method consisted of 5% B over 0–1.12 min, 5% to 100% B over 1.12–22.27 min, and 100% B until 29.49 min, after which the gradient was returned to 5% B at 29.56 min. In order to equilibrate the column with the initial mobile phase, 5% B was maintained until minute 35. The column oven was set to 40 °C, and the sample manager temperature to 4 °C.","MTBLS234"
"Mass spectrometry","The Synapt HDMS oa-Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) was equipped with an electrospray ion source operating in positive mode.  A solution of leucine enkephalin (556.2771 u, 400 pg/µl) in MeOH/H2O:1/1 containing 0.1% formic acid was infused as lockmass compound at a flow rate of 5 µl/min.

"Chromatography","For the generation of synthetic LC-MS datasets, we employed the software package MSSimulator [1]. The simulator creates profile data based on the experimentally determined retention time and the composition of a set of compounds. It can simulate different instrument resolutions, noise levels, and chromatographic performances. The datasets created here were based on experimentally identified metabolites and thus captured the complexity of a real-world sample. At the same time, the simulator provides complete control over signal-to-noise ratio, accuracy, and similar parameters that would be very difficult to vary independently of each other experimentally.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Bielow C., Aiche S., Andreotti S., and Reinert, K.

"Mass spectrometry","MSSimulator performed a raw signal simulation of 500 metabolites within the range of 100–1,000 m/z and with a simulated gradient runtime of 25 min. The machine-dependent settings of MSSimulator were chosen to be close to those of our experimental MS setup: The simulated MS resolution R was set to 20,000, and the scan time was set at 0.25 s. The output of MSSimulator consists of a centroided LC-MS measurement and a feature map summarizing all simulated metabolites with theoretical retention times, m/z ratios, and intensities. This feature map facilitates comparison between the ground truth (the simulator's input) and the features detected by our algorithm applied to the same simulated data.","MTBLS235"

"Metabolite identification","To assess the influence of different sources of noise on the feature-finding performance, we conducted three series of MS simulations, each affected by detector noise, m/z variation, or elution profile distortion. In the first series, we simulated increasing levels of detector noise that were controlled by the Gaussian standard deviation sdet. The second series comprised two datasets simulated with moderate and strong mass errors (Gaussian standard deviation sm/z set to 10 ppm and 40 ppm, respectively). For the third series, we simulated elution profiles with ideal peak shapes and heavily distorted shapes. In MSSimulator, the degree of distortion is controlled by the number of iterations ndist; that is, the greater the number of iterations performed, the more the elution profiles deviate from their smooth Gaussian shape. The configuration for each simulation is summarized in the supplemental material of the publication associated with this study.","MTBLS235"
"Sample collection","In total, 106 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB use at the University Clinic of Erlangen-Nuremberg from July 2009 thru August 2010 were included in this study. Operative procedures included coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic and/or mitral valve surgery (replacement and repair), combinations of CABG and heart valve surgery, and thoracic aortic surgery. For the determination of SCr levels, serum specimens were collected for each patient on the day before surgery and daily thereafter at 6:00 am. For patient classification according to the AKIN-criteria, SCr levels until the second day after surgery were taken into account. Of the 106 patients, 34 were diagnosed with AKI following surgery. In all five patients that required post-operative RRT, treatment was initiated more than 24 h after surgery. Hence, RRT did not affect metabolite levels in the simultaneously collected urine and plasma specimens. Written declarations of consent had been obtained from all study participants before inclusion. Spot urine samples were collected on the day before surgery, and at 4 and 24 hours after surgery. Urine was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min and the clear supernatant was immediately frozen and stored at -80 °C until NMR analysis. At 24 hours, an additional EDTA-plasma specimen was collected from each patient and stored at -80 °C.","MTBLS24"

"NMR sample","For NMR measurements of urine specimens, 400 μl of urine were mixed with 200 μl of 0.1 mol/l phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and 50 μl of 29.02 mmol/l 3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionate (TSP) in deuterium oxide as internal standard (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). EDTA-plasma specimens were ultrafiltrated with a cutoff of 10 kD to remove macromolecules and lipids. For subsequent NMR analysis, 400 μl of the ultrafiltrate were treated as described above.","MTBLS24"
"NMR spectroscopy","NMR experiments were carried out at 298 K on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer (BrukerBioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany).","MTBLS24"
"NMR assay","A 1D NOESY presaturation pulse sequence was used to analyze the urine samples. For each sample 128 scans were collected into 64k data points using a spectral width of 12.336 kHz (20 ppm) and an acquisition time of 2.66 s per FID.","MTBLS24"
"Data transformation","For equidistant binning, the region from 9.5 to 0.5 ppm of the 1D spectra was evenly split into bins of 0.01-ppm width using Amix 3.9.11 (BrukerBioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). After exclusion of the solvent area and the area containing the broad urea signal from 6.5 to 4.5 ppm, 701 bins remained for each 1D spectrum. Signal integrals from each bin were imported into the statistical-analysis software R version 2.14.0. To compensate for global variations in urine concentration caused, for example, by differences in fluid intake, all spectra were normalized prior to analysis by Quantile Normalization to achieve equal distributions of feature intensities across spectra. This approach corrects for dilution effects but preserves differences in concentration of individual metabolites due to other effects. For Quantile Normalization, the functions contained in the R-package affy (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/affy) were used.","MTBLS24"
"Metabolite identification","Assignments were obtained by comparison with reference spectra of pure compounds and verified by two dimensional NMR spectroscopy including 1H-13C Heteronuclear Signal Quantum Coherence (HSQC) and 1H-13C Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation (HMBC) Spectroscopy.","MTBLS24"
"Sample collection","Twenty DBA/1J male mice (6–7 weeks; Charles River Laboratories) were randomly divided in two groups (10 in CIA group, 10 in Ctrl group as healthy control). In the CIA group, immunization with collagen type II will provoke chronic polyarthritis by the induced autoimmune response. Each mouse was intraperitoneal induced (i.p.) with joint cartilage component collagen type II (CII; 100 µg diluted with a 100 µl volume 0.005 M acetic acid) which was extracted from bovine nasal cartilage (Funakoshi Co., Tokyo, Japan) at day 0 (T=0). Thereafter, the CII injection was repeated i.p. on days 14, 28, 42 and 56. In the ctrl mice, 100 µl of 0.005 M acetic acid alone was administered i.p. on the same days (0, 14, 28, 42 and 56). Next, to all experimental mice, 5 mg of Lipopolysaccharide from E. coli 011:B4 (Chondrex, Redmond, USA) dissolved in 100 µl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was given i.p. immediately after each injection of CII. In the ctrl group, 100 µl PBS was similarly administered as a control. All animals were maintained in a temperature and light controlled environment with free access to standard rodent chow and water. From day 71 to day 75, blood was taken from each animal of both groups and collected in pre-cooled tubes containing EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) as co-agulant (BD Vacutainer, Plymouth, UK). After centrifugation at 3000 x g for 10 minutes, the EDTA-plasma was collected and aliquots were stored at -80 ºC until further processing. 50 µl aliquot of mouse plasma was used for the oxylipins study.","MTBLS243"
"Extraction","Antioxidant mixture (5 µl) (0.4 mg/ml BHT and 0.4 mg/ml EDTA mixed with volume ratio 1:1) and a mixture of internal-standard mixtures (ISTDs) (5 µl, 1000 nM) were added into each 50 µl aliquot of mouse plasma. Subsequently the samples were loaded on the activated SPE plates (Oasis-HLB 96-well plates, 60 mg, 30 µm) and eluted using ethyl acetate (1.5 ml). The dried eluate was re-dissolved in 50 µl acetonitrile/methanol (50:50 v/v) and 5 µl were used for HPLC analysis.","MTBLS243"
"Chromatography","Separation was done by HPLC (Agilent 1290, San Jose, CA, USA) using an Ascentis Express C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 2.7 µm particles; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) with 0.35 ml flow during 28 min gradient.","MTBLS243"
"Mass spectrometry","The HPLC was coupled to electrospray ionization on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 6490, San Jose, CA, USA). Oxylipins were detected in negative ion mode using dynamic Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM).","MTBLS243"
"Data transformation","Peak areas were exported from Mass Hunter software (Agilent Technologies, version B.05.01) and ratios to internal standards were computed (target compounds/ ISTDs). Subsequently, an in-house developed QC agent was used to correct for instrument drift and batch effects. The reliability of the measurements was assessed by calculating the reproducibility of each metabolite in a QC pool, which was measured after every 10 samples. 30 unique oxylipins out of a target list of 110 oxylipins included in the metabolomics platform met the criteria RSD-QC <35% and were included in the final list for the further statistical analysis. Data were log transformed (Glog) and scaled by the standard deviation (auto-scaling) in order to get a normal distribution.","MTBLS243"

"Sample collection","Wild-type male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory; Bar Harbor, ME) aged 12 weeks were used in this study. Mice were maintained on a regular light (14 h)/dark(10 h) cycle and fed a standard laboratory chow diet (FED group) or high-fat diet (HFD group) containing 4.5 or 34 wt% fat in the diet, respectively. The third group of mice was fed a chow diet, but were fasted 14 h prior to euthanasia (FAS group). Starting with 6-week-old animals, the intervention trial was carried out two times under identical conditions. In each of the three groups, three animals were kept for 6 weeks in one cage per group with ad libitum access to food and water. During the intervention period, mice weights were monitored regularly. At the end of the 6 weeks feeding period, animals were euthanized at 8 AM under anesthesia with Narkodorm (60 µl/100 g weight) and the abdomen was surgically opened. Primary hepatocytes from livers were isolated as described previouly [1] with modifications. Prior to liver perfusion, buffers and collagenase type II solution (20 mg collagenase type II in 100 ml Krebs-Henseleit buffer without SO4(2-) but containing 0.1 mM CaCl2, 2% BSA) were brought to 37 °C. Each liver was perfused via the hepatic portal vein with Krebs-Henseleit buffer without Ca2+ and SO4(2-) (115 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.18 mM MgCl2, 1.23 mM NaH2PO4, 6 mM glucose) for 10 min, followed by perfusion with collagenase type II solution. Thereafter, liver was carefully removed and transferred into a Petri dish filled with 5 ml collagenase type II solution, cut into small pieces, and pressed through a household sieve that was finally flushed with ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1.2 mM Na2SO4 and 1.25 mM CaCl2. The cell suspension obtained was filtrated through a cell strainer (70 µm nylon filter) into a 50 ml Greiner tube. Approximately 20 ml ice-cold DMEM was added to the filtrated cell suspension, which was subsequently centrifuged at 50 x g in a Beckman CS-6R rotor for 3 min at 4 °C. Supernatant containing nonparenchymal cells was aspirated, and the remaining hepatocyte pellet was washed by resuspension of the cell pellet in 20 ml ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1.2 mM Na2SO4 and 1.25 mM CaCl2 and centrifuged again under the same conditions as were applied before. Hepatocytes obtained in this manner were stored at 80 °C until isolation of LDs.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Riccalton-Banks L, Bhandari R, Fry J, Shakesheff KM.

"Extraction","Samples of hepatocytes isolated from individual mice were resuspended in disruption buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF) and kept for 15 min on ice. The cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 800 psi for 10 min using nitrogen bomb, and the resulting homogenate was transferred to a 50 ml Greiner tube and centrifuged at 1,000 x g (Beckman CS-6R rotor) for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant obtained was transferred to a SW41 ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF. The centrifugation was carried out at 100,000 x g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor, Beckman Coulter; Brea, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C; LDs were floated in a white band at the top of the tube. Floating LDs were collected into another SW41 tube, overlaid with the same buffer, and centrifuged at the same speed in the Beckman ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor) for 1 h at 4 °C to avoid cytosol contamination. Refloating LDs were collected and used in all further experiments. LDs isolated from hepatocytes were measured individually (6 each for FED, FAS, and HFD group) according to the hyphenated approach described previously [1]. In brief, samples were spiked with 40 nmol TG 17:0/17:0/17:0 and 400 pmol PC 12:0/12:0 as internal standards, and lipids were extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether as described previously [2]. Lipid extracts were resuspended in 200 µl CHCl3/MeOH 1:1, and a mix of 45 LIPID MAPS internal standards was added.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Fauland A, Köfeler H, Trötzmüller M, Knopf A, Hartler J, Eberl A, Chitraju C, Lankmayr E, Spener F.

"Chromatography","Spiked samples of volume 5 µl were injected onto a 100 x 1 mm Hypersil GOLD 1.9 µm C18 HPLC column (Thermo Scientific) mounted in an Accela HPLC instrument (Thermo Scientific). Solvent A was water with 1% ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid, solvent B was acetonitrile/2-propanol 5:2 (v/v) with 1% ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid. The gradient ran from 35% to 70% B in 4 min, then to 100% B in another 16 min, and was held there for further 10 min. The flow rate was 250 µl/min.","MTBLS26"
"Mass spectrometry","Data acquisition was performed by Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR-MS) (Linear Trap Quadrupole-Fourier Transform, LTQ-FT; Thermo Scientific) full scans at a resolution of 200,000 and <2 ppm mass accuracy with external calibration. Spray voltage was set to 5,000 V in positive mode and to -4,500 V in negative mode, capillary voltage to 35 V, and the tube lens was at 120 V. Capillary temperature was set to 250 °C. From the FT-ICR-MS preview scan, the four most-abundant m/z values were picked in data-dependent acquisition mode, fragmented in the linear ion trap, and ejected at nominal mass resolution.

"Metabolite identification","Constituent FA of phosphatidylserine (PS), PE, PC, DG, and TG species were analyzed in positive MS/MS spectra by respective FA neutral losses. FA composition of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) and sphingomyelins (SMs) was obvious by elemental composition derived from high-resolution MS data and by lipid class-specific fragments (m/z 184). FA composition for phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular species was elucidated by their carboxylate anions in negative MS/MS spectra. The most abundant FA fragment or neutral loss in an MS/MS spectrum was normalized to 100% (base peak). Fragments indicative for FA with less than 25% intensity of the base peak were termed minor FA fragments and all others were termed major FA fragments. For better manageability, particularly of isobaric species, possible combinations predominantly composed of major fragments were considered major molecular species, and possible combinations predominantly composed of minor fragments were considered minor molecular species. On the one hand quantitative mass spectrometric data for each lipid species are given in ‰ (or %) relative to total amount of a lipid class and pertain to 1st and 2nd intervention trials, consequently they are means ± SD of 6 animals. Total lipid class amounts were calculated as sum from individual lipid species; the standard deviation of the lipid class is a result of the individual standard deviations of each species determined by the law of error propagation.","MTBLS26"
"Analysis","Independent two-sample t-test for equal sample sizes and equal variance was used to assess statistical significance of the observed changes at a level of P < 0.05. This type of calculation was chosen, because it illustrates relative changes in the lipid profile between different statistical groups very well. On the other hand mass spectrometric data for each lipid species in nmol (or µmol) per LD sample are presented as means ± SD (n = 3). These additional values pertain to the second intervention trial and were calculated by LDA based on sets of internal standards for each lipid class as described previously [1][2]. For better comparability, data were normalized to the amount of acylglycerols measured by the TG Kit referred to previously in this section. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on ‰ data (n = 6) was performed in R using the function prcomp with default parameters.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Fauland A, Köfeler H, Trötzmüller M, Knopf A, Hartler J, Eberl A, Chitraju C, Lankmayr E, Spener F.

The rest of the fragmented genomic DNA was resuspended in a 1 ml final reaction volume containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 and 1.5 µg/µl BSA. To this, at least 2.5 µg of the dA6m Ab (Synaptic Systems GmbH, m6A antibody, Cat. No. 202003) was added. Alternatively, the following antibodies were used: dA6m Ab* (Synaptic Systems GmbH, m6A antibody, Cat. No. 202011), dA6m Ab** (Synaptic Systems GmbH, m6A antibody, Cat. No. 202111), IgG (Abcam, Cat. No. ab171870). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C on a rotor, 100 µl of prewashed protein A magnetic beads were added for 2 hrs at 4 °C. Next, the supernatant was removed while Ab bound to the beads was retained using a magnet. After 5 washes with the washing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630), the DNA bound Ab fraction was eluted. For almost all applications, the DNA was eluted from the Ab and beads with 150 µl of elution buffer that contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, 6.7 mM methylated adenosine triphophate). The mixture was then incubated for 1 hr with continuous shaking at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed, and then another 150 µl of elution buffer was added to remove any unbound remaining fraction. Next, the supernatants were combined, precipitated, and used for subsequent analysis.</p>DNA oligos:</br>Synthetic oligos were used on dot-blots and pulldown studies.

"Extraction","The samples to be analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) were diluted in a volume of 250 µl. The samples were then denatured by heating the samples at 100 °C for 5min and immediately placing them on ice. 20 µl of 20 mM ZnSO4 and 10 µl of the nuclease P1 (200 units/ml in 30 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.3) were added, in order to digest any DNA strands into individual nucleotides. After an overnight incubation at 50 °C, 180 µl of water, and 1 µl of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP, 150 U/µl) were added. After a 24 hr incubation at 37 °C, 1 ul of the BAP was added again, and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for another hour. Next, 30 µl of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) was added, and the phosphatase reaction was continued for another hour at 37 °C. Next, 400 µl of water was added, together with silicic acid that filled the 1.7 ml Eppendorf tube to about 200 µl. After incubation for 15 min with occasional vortexing, the sample mixture was transferred onto 0.45 µm cellulose acetate filters.  After centrifugation the silicic acid granules were removed. The flow through was then analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS.","MTBLS276"
"Chromatography","Analysis of global levels of dA and dA6m was performed on a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC fitted with an Acquity UHPLC HSS T3 column (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm particle size). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) at a flow rate of 300 µl/min. Calibration curves were generated using serial dilutions of synthetic standards for deoxyadenosine (dA, Sigma) and N6-methyl-2’-deoxyadenosine (dA6m, Sigma).","MTBLS276"
"Mass spectrometry","The Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer was set in a positive ion mode and operated in parallel reaction monitoring. Ions of masses 252.11 (dA) and 266.12 (dA6m) were fragmented and full scans were acquired for the base fragments 136.0618 and 150.0774 ± 5ppm (adenine and methyladenine, respectively).","MTBLS276"
"Data transformation","No data conversion was carried out on the output raw data files.","MTBLS276"
"Metabolite identification","The EIC of the base fragment was used for quantification. Accurate mass of the corresponding base-fragment was extracted using the XCalibur Qual Browser and XCalibur Quan Browser software (Thermo Scientific), and used for quantification.","MTBLS276"
"Sample collection","Urine samples from 469 NSCLC patients prior to treatment and 536 population controls collected from 1998 to 2007 from the greater Baltimore, Maryland, area were employed as a training set. Population controls were identified from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) lists and frequency-matched to cases by age, gender, and self reported race.","MTBLS28"
"Extraction","Urine samples were diluted with an equal volume of 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing debrisoquine (ESI+ internal standard) and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (ESI- internal standard). Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to precipitate proteins.","MTBLS28"
"Chromatography","A 5 µl sample was chromatographed on a 50 x 2.1 mm Acquity BEH 1.7 µm C18 column (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) using an Acquity UPLC system (Waters). To avoid artifacts based on sample injection order, the order was randomized. The gradient mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (B). A typical 10-min sample run (at 0.5ml/ml) consisted of 0.5 min of 100% solvent A followed by a linear gradient to 80% A at 4 min, to 5% A at 8 min. After a 0.5 min wash step, the column was equilibrated to initial conditions for 1.5 min.","MTBLS28"
"Mass spectrometry","The eluent was introduced by electrospray ionization into the mass spectrometer (Waters QTOF Premier) operating in positive (ESI+) or negative (ESI-) ionization mode. The capillary and sampling cone voltages were set to 3,000 and 30 V, respectively. Source and desolvation temperatures were set to 120 ºC and 350 ºC, respectively, and the cone and desolvation gas flows were set to 50.0 and 650.0 l/h, respectively. To maintain mass accuracy, sulfadimethoxine at a concentration of 300 pg/µl in 50% acetonitrile was used as a lock mass and injected at a rate of 50 µl/min. For MS scanning, data were acquired in centroid mode from 50 to 850 m/z and for tandem MS the collision energy was ramped from 5 to 35 V.","MTBLS28"
"Data transformation","In the NCI-MD cohort, chromatograms were first visually inspected using Waters MassLynx to ensure their quality and 12 samples were removed due to poor quality (e.g. undetectable spiked in control, break in signal). All subsequent data analyses were performed using R, a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R package XCMS2, version 1.22.1, was utilized to extract and align peaks for all detected metabolites. Peak areas for all signals were extracted using the following criteria: ppm=25, mzdiff=-0.005, snthresh = 10, scanrange=c(1,500), peakwidth=c(5,12), prefilter=c(1,30)). Retention times were aligned using one iteration of the rector() function using the loess method, which performs smoothing of the retention time deviations for every time point in each sample. Peaks were then found using the group() function with the following parameters: bw=10, minfrac=0.1, mzwid=0.01. Next, ESI+ and ESI- signals were merged on lung cancer cases and healthy control samples that were in common between both sets (N = 1257) and signals with masses that had a ppm error larger than 50 were removed from further analysis. This filtering reduced the total number of signals from 2756 and 1804 to 1807 and 1359, for ESI+ and ESI- modes, respectively. Next, a normalization algorithm analogous to MSTUS (MS 'total useful signal')3 normalization was applied. Signals that are putative xenobiotics (e.g., acetaminophen) were removed before calculating the scaling factor using the following criteria: signals with very high abundance (> 90th percentile) in at most 100 samples and with very low abundance (<= 20th percentile) in at least 800 samples. Scaling factors, total intensity counts for each sample divided by the mean total intensity counts of all samples, were then used to normalize signal abundances. Finally, signals with variation (measured by coefficients of variation) between duplicates higher than variations between randomly selected sample pairs were removed.","MTBLS28"
"Metabolite identification","Identification of biomarkers was initiated by searching their high accuracy masses in METLIN and HMDB databases. If no database hits were returned, spectral interpretation of the MS/MS product ion mass and MS3 spectra were used to generate putative structures. Metabolite identity was confirmed by comparing retention times and product ion mass spectra and by monitoring characteristic fragmentation patterns in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode against those of commercially available and in-house synthesized standards.","MTBLS28"
"Sample collection","Seawater samples were collected from near Long Key State Park, FL (24.8169° N 80.8200° W) by scuba divers (4-5 m depth). Acid-washed Nalgene syringes (100 ml) attached to 1 l FlexFoil Plus sample bags (SKC, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) via a three-way valve with Teflon tubing were used to collect ambient reef water and exhalent water from the sponge.  Ambient water was collected near each sponge but away from the direction of the exhalent plume of the sponge.  Exhalent water from each sponge was collected by drawing water into the syringe slowly (1 ml/s) through tubing placed just above the osculum for Spheciospongia vesparium and just above the base of the spongeocoel for Ircinia campana.  Seawater away from sponge filtration (off-reef seawater) was collected in Nalgene bottles (n=2, 1.5 l total) by hand near the surface and approximately 300 m seaward from the reef, over a mix of sand and hard substrate. The seawater was put on ice immediately upon end of the dive and was filtered through a combusted glass fiber filter (GF/F; 0.7 µm, Whatman) and a 0.2 µm PTFE filter (Omnipore, Millipore, MA, UA) filters the same day.","MTBLS281"
"Extraction","The seawater was filtered through 0.2 micron filter. The filtrate was processed using solid phase extraction (SPE) with 1 g/6 cc PPL cartridges (BondElut, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as described previously [1] to remove salt. Metabolites were eluted from the column using 100% methanol and these were stored at -20 °C until analysis. Just prior to analysis on the instruments described below, the methanol extract was dried down and redissolved in 500 µl of 95:5 water:acetonitrile and deuterated biotin was added to each sample as a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) injection standard (final concentration 0.05 µg/ml). At this stage, 100 and 200 µl of the extract was removed for targeted and untargeted metabolomics analysis respectively.

"Chromatography","For targeted metabolomics analysis, the samples were analyzed with a Synergi 4 µm Fusion – RP 80 Å, 150 x 2.00 mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) coupled to a Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage Triple Stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. The chromatography gradient was: an initial hold of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water) : 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 2 min, ramp to 65% B from 2 to 20 min, ramp to 100% B from 20 to 25 min, and hold until 32.5 min. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. Eight-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration.</p>For untargeted metabolomics analysis, LC separation was performed using a Synergi Fusion reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the same gradient as for targeted analysis.","MTBLS281"
"Mass spectrometry","For targeted analysis, samples were analyzed with a Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage Triple Stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. This instrument allows polarity switching between positive and negative ion mode within a single LC run. Analysis of authentic standards was used to determine the optimal ionization mode for each metabolite.</p>For untargeted analysis, samples were analyzed in both negative and positive ion mode with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled by electrospray ionization to a 7-Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). In parallel to the FT acquisition, four data dependent MS/MS scans were collected at nominal mass resolution in the ion trap (LTQ). Samples were analyzed in random order with a pooled sample run at the start, middle, and end of the run in order to assess instrument variability.","MTBLS281"
"Data transformation","Targeted metabolomics data were analyzed using XCalibur 2.0. The concentration of the metabolites in the targeted mass spectrometry data is given in ng/ml.

Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [3], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps.

"Extraction","Cell counting:</br>Prior to spotting the cells on the MAMS target for the MALDI-MS measurement, the cells were reconstituted in 500 µl of a MeOH/ddH2O mixture (60:40) + 0.85% (w/V) ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pre-cooled at -40 °C, and carefully shaken to avoid cell aggregation. The samples were transferred to pre-cooled Eppendorf vials (2 ml). The Eppendorf vials were centrifuged at -10 °C for 1 min at 1000 x g (fixed rotor). The supernatant was removed to avoid any remaining growth medium to be trapped in the cell pellet. The cell pellet was reconstituted in 50 µl of 60% MeOH in ddH2O (-40 °C) and slightly shaken. Then, 2 µl of the cell suspension (2,500,000 cells/ml) was spread over a cooled MAMS plate (-4 °C). The distribution of the number of cells per well is stochastic (i.e. Poisson distribution). After the cells were distributed on the MAMS chip, the rest of the reconstituted yeast sample was once more centrifuged and shock frozen for population-level (bulk sample) control measurements at a later time point. To avoid any changes to the metabolism during the cell counting step, the MAMS plate was cooled using liquid nitrogen in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere (with a constant flow of N2 gas) to avoid condensation of moisture from air on the surfaces of the MAMS chip and the microscope optics. To avoid any cross-contamination between empty- and cell-containing-wells in the MAMS, the chip was placed in a dry-freezing cham ber for 15 min, after counting the cells. This step allowed us to remove residual moisture that remains on the surface of the MAMS chip prior the matrix deposi tion step. Most of the metabolites that were detected in this publication, using the MAMS platform, are the most abundant metabolites found within S. cerevisiae cells.</p>Cell handling:</br>The cell handling protocol was adapted from [1]. In brief the workflow consisted on the following: 1 ml from the main culture of yeast cells (YSBN.6) was quenched in 4 ml of a MeOH/ddH2O mixture (60:40) + 0.85% (w/V) ammonium bicarbonate buffer, and pre-cooled at -40 °C. Three types of aliquots were prepared from the main culture of yeast cells: Reference samples were untreated aliquots; Control samples were aliquots treated with 500 µl of HPLC-MS grade water (ddH2O) at 4 °C; and Treated samples were aliquots treated with 500 µl of a 2% (mg/ml) solution of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (HPLC-MS grade water). The falcon tubes containing the different aliquots were immediately submerged in a -40 °C glycerol bath for 1 min to ensure quenching of the metabolism. The samples were then centrifuged for 1 min at -10 °C at 1000 x g in a non-fixed rotor centrifuge. The supernatant (growth medium) was removed, and the falcon tube containing the cell pellet was then shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until the measurement.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Ewald JC, Heux S, Zamboni N (2009) High-throughput quantitative metabolomics: Workflow for cultivation, quenching, and analysis of yeast in a multiwell format.

"Mass spectrometry","MS measurement:</br>The MALDI MS measurements were carried out on a commercial MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (ABI4800 Plus, AB Sciex, Concord/ON, Canada). This instrument is equipped with a 355-nm solid-state laser. Measurements were conducted in the negative-ion reflectron mode, analyzing a mass range between 70 and 1100 m/z, and using 100 shots (10 subspectra x 10 shots) with center biased rastering. In our measurements, we heavily rely on the accuracy of the mass measurements for confidence on the metabolite identity. In order to exclude any possible mass shifts that may be caused by slightly tilted surfaces or in homogeneity of the conductivity of the MAMS coating and therefore irregular electric fields, we introduced evenly spaced calibration spots surrounding the 100 µm array. Prior to each MS measurement, the MS instrument was calibrated using 13 metabolite standards evenly distributed in the mass range of interest.</p>MS/MS analyses were conducted using the collision-induced dissociation (CID) cell in the ABI4800 instrument and air as the collision gas. Unfortunately, tandem mass spectrometry on the same cell sample is not possible in our case, due to limited amount of material present within one microwell. Therefore, we normally carried out tandem MS measurements on different wells to the one in which the parent ions were originally measured. Some times, it was necessary to combine the MS/MS measurements of a whole MAMS chip to obtain a suitable tandem MS spectrum. Therefore, it was critically also for our purposes to align the MAMS plate (i.e. the microwells) with the laser ionization spots using optical marks. By using the alignment marks, it was possible to run automated measurements, using the ABI mass spectrometer software, in a reproducible manner.</p>MS/MS measurement:</br>MS/MS analyses were conducted using the collision-induced dissociation (CID) cell in the ABI4800 instrument (1 KV) and air as the collision gas on MAMS and stainless steel MALDI plates.

"Data transformation","Data treatment and data analysis software Spectral data (i.e. accurate mass, signal intensity, peak resolution) were calculated from the raw spectra using the ABI4800 software package (4000 Series Explorer V3.5.3, and Data Explorer Software Version 4.9).","MTBLS29"
"Metabolite identification","Chemical assignments (identities) of 26 metabolites were made on the basis of accurate mass measurements (accuracy of 20 ppm or better), the isotope ratios of the corresponding signals, and metabolic databases (ChemBioFinder [http://chembiofinder.cambridgesoft.com/]; Chemspider [http://www.chemspider.com/]; Kegg [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/]; Metlin [http://metlin.scripps.edu/]; and Yeastnet [http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/yeastnet/]).</p>The chemical assignments were verified by comparing the respective tandem MS/MS spectra to the ones obtained from commercially available standards, and by using 13C-labeled cells, which were obtained by growing the yeast cells in 13C-labeled glucose. In order to exclude data with faulty assignments, the masses of at least 24 metabolites must be present in the spectrum with a mass deviation lower than 20 ppm (ideally lower than 15 ppm). Phosphoglyceric acid and Acetyl-Coenzyme A were not considered for further data analysis due to their constant mass deviation of 20 ppm or higher. Any spectra that did not contain all 24 metabolites signals within this mass error were discarded.</p>If the ABI4800 software package was unable to recognize a precise peak (even if the S/N ratio was higher than 3), the peak resolution was calculated manually, and the mass intensity as well as its mass-to-charge ratio were calculated from ASCII files using a MATLAB peak recognition software (version 7.6.0.324 (R2010a), MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The ASCII files were generated using macros written within the ABI Data Explorer Software. All data from the ABI software packages were then exported to Microsoft Excel(TM). In Excel, the signal intensities for each metabolite in one MAMS microwell, were divided by a known 9-amino acridine unsaturated background signal ([C4H2O4 - H]-, m/z 112.98933) and the number of cells counted within that well, providing us with the relative signal intensity for each metabolite at the single-cell level. This simple procedure allowed us to compensate for any inconsistencies in the matrix deposition, shot-to-shot and spot-to-spot variation, as well as in differences in the number of trapped cells (biomass) between MAMS microwells. However, to avoid other unexpected sources of variation (e.g. signal suppression, inefficient metabolite extraction, etc) between MAMS substrates, we used the signal of one of the measured metabolite as internal standard. In our case, we selected glutamate (C5H9NO4 - H]-, m/z 146.04588) as an internal standard, since its relative signal intensity for a whole MAMS plate remains constant, within the time frame of our study and for the different measured sample treatment if the cells originated from the same colony innoculation. Therefore, all metabolite signals obtained from one MAMS chip were adjusted by one single factor, if the average glutamate signal in the whole MAMS plate had a deviation of 10% or more from the expected value. Such complex data processing is necessary to reduce the technical variability between measurements, which if not removed or minimize could later been misinterpretate as cell-to-cell variability.","MTBLS29"

To compare only the effects of genotype for fasted and for fed mice separately, an ANOVA analysis with contrasts of each set of metabolites was performed. We used the Benjamini and Hochberg method for estimation of FDR (False Discovery Rate) [1]. The cut-offs for differentially expressed metabolites was FDR = 0.1. Zero values observed in the raw data were considered as missing. Metabolites with more than 10% missing data have been excluded from the analysis. Raw data values were log-transformed prior to analysis to establish distributions closer to the Gaussian. The total number of metabolites analyzed for each tissue was the following: plasma = 60; liver = 67; muscle = 77; brain = 67; heart = 74. The results are presented as heat maps and Venn diagrams. Heat maps were generated using dChip (www.dchip.org).</p>Standardized z-scores of the log2-transformed values were used for heat maps of raw data with blue representing low z-score values and red representing high z-score values, respectively.

Pink indicates significant statistical interactions. ANOVA with contrasts results are represented as heat maps, where red indicates that KO is significantly higher than WT, and blue indicates that KO is significantly lower than WT.

"Sample Collection","Patients were recruited at the district hospital Centre Médical avec Antenne Chirurgicale Saint Camille in malaria-endemic Nanoro, Burkina Faso. Admitted children < 15 years of age presenting with axillary temperature = 38 °C, or clinical signs of severe illness were enrolled. Medical history, physical examination and outcome of febrile episode were registered on a standardized form. At time of hospital admission, venous whole blood for blood culture, malaria diagnosis, full blood count, glucose measurements, plasma metabolome analysis, and 16S rRNA deep sequencing were collected from all participants by trained study nurses.</p>Samples were submitted within 15 min after collection to the lab facility of the Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro (CRUN), which is located on the compound of the district hospital St. Camille.</p>1-3 ml venous blood was collected into a pediatric blood culture bottle (BD BACTEC Preds Plus TM/F, Becton Dickinson and Company, USA). Blood culture bottles were incubated in a BACTEC 9050 instrument (Becton Dickinson) for a total of 5 days. If flagged for growth they were Gram stained, subcultured on EMB agar and 5% Sheep Blood agar (bioMérieux, France) and incubated at 35-37 °C for 24 h in atmospheric conditions and at 5% CO2 respectively. Isolates were identified to the species level by standard biochemical methods.</p> Thick and thin blood films were stained with 3% Giemsa solution, and examined for presence of Plasmodium species according to standard procedures by at least 2 experienced microscopists. Results were expressed as asexual parasites per µl using the patient’s white blood cell count.</p>The malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) recommended by the national malaria control program, SD Bioline Pf (Standard Diagnostics, Korea) detecting P. falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2), was performed on EDTA blood samples according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>Decision for additional infectious disease testing (e.g. HIV) was left to the discretion of attending health staff; only 1 study participant was identified as HIV-positive.</p>Full blood counts were assessed using Sysmex XS1000i (Sysmex Corporation, Japan). Full blood was collected on NaF tubes for glucose level measurement on Flexor Junior (Vital Scientific, Netherlands).</p>For metabolomics analysis, one 1 ml EDTA blood sample was centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C for plasma separation. The plasma fraction was divided in 100 µl aliquots and immediately frozen at -80 °C. Plasma aliquots were stored within 2 h of sample collection, plasma processing times were kept in the study log book. Plasma samples were shipped on dry ice with temperature-control to the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp for metabolite extraction.</p>Leftover EDTA blood samples (200-1000 µl) were kept at -80 °C at CRUN and utilized for additional molecular diagnosis of BSI. PCR products resulting from amplification of the V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were deep sequenced on the Illumnia MiSeq platform (Illumina, USA). The sequencing reads underwent a quality filtering process using mothur. Paired reads were joined into single contigs and any contigs with ambiguous bases or a length longer than the 2 individual read lengths, were removed. Taxonomy was assigned using GAST and the associated full length 16S SILVA reference database (retrieved 13/02/15). Taxonomy assignments found within any negative control samples were labeled as potential contaminants and removed from all samples. Samples were only considered positive if a taxonomy assignment up to species level of a clinically significant organism could be reproduced in 2 repeated sequencing experiments.","MTBLS315"
"Extraction","GC-MS:</br>For GC-MS, a 50 µl plasma aliquot was thawed on ice followed by addition of 100 µl ultrapure methanol. An additional 100 µl internal standard solution (0.2 mg/ml succinic-d4 acid, benzoic d5 acid, glycine-d5, lysine-d4 from Cambridge Isotope laboratories, UK) was added. The resulting mixture was vortex mixed and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 15 min. Following centrifugation, 125 µl of the clean supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and dried in a centrifugal vacuum evaporator for 16 hrs. </p>C18-UHPLC-MS:</br>For C18-UHPLC-MS, a 50 µl plasma aliquot was thawed on ice followed by addition of 100 µl ultrapure methanol. The resulting mixture was vortex mixed and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 15 min. Following centrifugation, 125 µl of the clean supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and dried in a centrifugal vacuum evaporator for 16 hrs. </p>C8-LC-MS:</br>Samples for lipid analysis on C8-LC-MS positive mode were prepared with a butanol/methanol extraction. The extraction solvent was prepared by mixing equal amounts of pure butanol and methanol, 10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% butylated hydroxytoluene and 2.5 µM internal standard solution including D31PE(34:1), D31PS(34:1) and D31PI(34:1) (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., USA ). A 10 µl plasma aliquot was thawed on ice and mixed with 90 µl of the extraction solvent. The mixture was vortexed for 30 sec and sonicated for 30 min, all the while ensuring that temperature was maintained at room temperature (20 °C). The resulting mix was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 0 °C, and 50 µl of the supernatant was directly transferred to 0.2 ml micro-inserts of LC-MS glass vials with Teflon insert caps.","MTBLS315"
"Chromatography","GC-MS:</br>Samples for GC-MS analysis were prepared applying a two-stage chemical derivatisation procedure (oximation followed by trimethylsilylation) and followed by analysis applying an electron inonisation GC-TOF-MS system (Agilent 6890N GC coupled to a LECO Pegasus III mass spectrometer). 5 QC samples were analysed at the start of each analytical batch to condition the analytical system and a QC sample was analysed every 5th injection. The study samples were analysed in 2 analytical experimental batches.</p>C18-UHPLC-MS:</br>For C18-UHPLC-MS, samples were analysed as described by [1]. Briefly, the samples were reconstituted in 50 µl water and analysed applying C18-UHPLC-Orbitrap MS (Thermo Accela UHPLC coupled to a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer) over a 25 min runtime. 10 QC samples were analysed at the start of an analytical batch to condition the analytical system and a QC sample was analysed every 5th injection. The study samples were analysed in 1 analytical batch. </p>C8-LC-MS:</br>For C8-LC-MS, the samples were analysed as described earlier by [2]. Briefly the samples were analysed on a C8-LC-QTOF (Agilent 1290 LC coupled to an Agilent QTOF 6550 mass spectrometer) with a 30 min runtime. 10 solvent samples were analysed at the start of the analytical batch to condition the system and a QC sample was analysed every 4th injection. All study samples were analysed in 1 analytical batch. Samples were analysed in randomized order in each experiment. </p>Ref:</br>[1] Dunn WB, Broadhurst D, Begley P, et al.

"Data transformation","GC-MS:</br>The two batches of raw GC-ToF-MS data files were peak picked and deconvolved using an internal deconvolution algorithm within the ChromaTof 2.1 software (Leco). This was applied stipulating an increasing peak width of 1.5 s (at 400 s) expanding to 1.8 s (at 800 s), a baseline cut-off at 0.5 and aligning to an internal retention index (decane, dodecane, pentadecane and nonadecane).  In order to account for instrumental drift, an in-house LOESS correction curve was splined through each QC data point and each analytical point aligned accordingly.</p>C18-UHPLC-MS and C8-LC-MS:</br>The LC-MS raw data files were converted into the mzXML format by msConvert. Further processing was handled by a flexible data processing pipeline implemented in R called mzMatch.R which includes XCMS-based mass chromatogram extraction and retention time alignment, peak matching, noise removal, contaminant removal based on extraction and solvent blanks, implementation dilution trend correlation filter to further remove non-informative peaks, correction signal drift over time based on fitting a LOESS function on the data of the QC samples, and peak derivative removal (isotopes, adducts, dimers and fragments) based on correlation analysis on both peak shape and intensity pattern. </p>GC-MS, C18-UHPLC-MS and C8-LC-MS:</br>Metabolite peaks were considered to be detected reproducibly when they were detected in all QC samples and when the quantitative variation of the signal intensity across all the QC samples was less than 15% relative standard deviation (RSD) for the LC-MS platforms (samples analyzed in 1 analytical batch) and less than 20% RSD for GC-MS (samples analysed in 2 analytical batches). All peaks that did not fulfill these criteria were removed. Non-informative peaks that would not yield interesting biomarkers were also removed from the dataset and included: (i) peaks with signal intensity close to the limit of detection, (ii) peaks detected in less than 3 out of the 61 study samples, (iii) peaks that are near-constant in all included patient samples (RSD <15%). The final peak set obtained for each LC-MS platform was visually inspected to ensure that all included peaks corresponded to good-quality mass- chromatograms. </p>Missing values in the data-matrix obtained per analytical platform were replaced with half the minimum value of the entire matrix of that analytical batch.","MTBLS315"
"Metabolite identification","GC-MS:</br>After deconvolution of the GC-MS data, metabolite identification was performed initially against an in-house metabolite reference database of over 1500 internal standards (generally linked to primary metabolism) and then subsequently against putative mass spectral fragmentation patterns within the NIST 8.0 spectral database (containing mass spectra from over 800,000 different compounds).</p>C18-UHPLC-MS and C8-LC-MS:</br>The selected LC-MS peaks were putatively identified by matching the masses (mass accuracy < 5 ppm) progressively to those from metabolite-specific databases. In a first round of identification, we used the Human Metabolome Database, KEGG, and a contaminant database. Only the remaining unidentified peaks went through a second round of matching to LIPIDMAPS and METLIN spectral database.  </p>Statistical analysis:</br>The final metabolite features (i.e., peaks that could be identified to one of the four levels designated by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative) of all three analytical platforms were merged into 1 data-matrix that was checked in R for outlying samples using standard chemometric agents including principal component analysis  and Mahalanobis distance. No outliers were detected and all samples were included in subsequent statistical analysis.</p>All statistical analyses were also performed using the R software environment which comprises a selection of packages suitable for the implemented statistical methods: multivariate analysis (partial-least-squares (PLS) regression), receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis, correlation analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, biomarker validation and Bayesian latent class modeling.","MTBLS315"

"Sample collection","S. Typhimurium wild type cells (ATCC 14028) were used throughout this study and were taken from a single colony on an agar plate, subsequently inoculated into 7 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) media (comprised of 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% sodium chloride at pH 7), and incubated overnight at 37°C. The overnight culture was centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The cell pellets were suspended in LB media and centrifuged again, and the supernatant was discarded. For LB cultures, the cell pellets were subsequently suspended in 2 mL of LB media and used to inoculate 700 mL of LB in a 2.8 L flask. After 160 min of growth, cells were harvested via centrifugation (4,000×g) and washed twice with Dulbecco’s PBS (Mediatech) once cultures reached an OD600 of +1.0. To stimulate the Salmonella virulence program, cells were transferred to a low pH, low magnesium, and low iron (LPM) medium comprised of 8 µM MgCL2, 0.5 µM ferric citrate, 5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM NH4SO4, 0.5 mM K2SO4, 0.3% glycerol v/v, 0.00001% thiamine, 337 µM H3PO4, and 80 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid at pH 5.8. Briefly, cell pellets from the 7 mL LB media were suspended in LPM media and centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were suspended in 2 mL of LPM media and used to inoculate 700 mL of LPM in a 2.8 L flask. Cells were harvested after 4 h or 20 h, then washed and isolated as above. Three biological replicates were performed for each of the conditions described above.","MTBLS35"
"Extraction","Cell pellets were stored at -80°C prior to thawing and were subsequently resuspended in an appropriate volume of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate according to their wet weight to compensate for any differences in cell numbers. The cells were lysed by bead-beating, and the lysates were transferred into new tubes. Subsequently, 100 µL aliquots of cell lysates were extracted with four volumes of chilled (-20°C) chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the aqueous phases after centrifugation were transferred to glass vials and dried in vacuo (SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). All samples were kept at -80°C prior to chemical derivatization for GC-MS analysis.","MTBLS35"
"Chromatography","Chromatography was carried out on an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph using the manufacturer's software (Chemstation) and a HP-5MS gas chromatography column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA; 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness).","MTBLS35"
"Mass spectrometry","Samples were analyzed in duplicate using an Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using a HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies). One microliter of each sample was injected in splitless mode and with the port temperature held at 250°C throughout analysis. The GC oven was initially maintained at 60°C for 1 min and then ramped to 325°C by 10°C/min and kept at this final temperature for 5 min to complete an analysis cycle. Derivatized metabolites eluting from the GC column were ionized using electron ionization (70 eV), and data were collected over the mass range 50-550 m/z.","MTBLS35"
"Data transformation","After converting raw data to netCDF format, the data were processed by the MetaboliteDetector software for peak deconvolution and chromatographic alignment. Retention indices (RI) were calculated based on the analysis of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (C8 - C30) (Agilent Technologies) as external retention time standards, then their retention index information was subsequently applied to all experimental chromatograms for retention time alignment. MetaboliteDetector parameters for peak detection and deconvolution are as follows: Peak threshold, 7; minimum peak height, 7; deconvolution width, 8.","MTBLS35"
"Metabolite identification","Deconvoluted features were identified by matching to the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked Library, which contains mass spectral and retention index information for approximately 700 metabolites. Each initial match to the library was manually inspected to confirm a confident identification. MetaboliteDetector software was used for database matching and batch identification/quantification parameters are as follows: required score, 0.6; ΔRI, 25; minimum S/N, 20; maximum peak discrepancy index, 100. Ions 73 and 143 were excluded from use as metabolite quantification ions, since these are due to fragmentation of the trimethylsilyl groups. Otherwise, three unique fragment ions were assigned to each metabolite for quantification and used for each individual GC-MS analysis when processing the data in batch mode. The summed areas of the three quantification ions were exported from MetaboliteDetector and used in further statistical anayses.

"Sample collection","Liquid cultures of C. reinhardtii wild-type (WT) cc406 and mutant strain Stm6Glc4 (18) were grown in Tris acetate phosphate medium under continuous illumination (40 µmol x m^-2 x s^-1 white light, measured with a QSL 2100 laboratory radiometer (Biospherical Instruments Inc.)). The WT cc406 was selected as reference strain, because Stm6Glc4 originated from a similar genetic background. For H2 production experiments, cultures were grown under continuous illumination in Tris acetate phosphate medium until they reached the late logarithmic growth phase. After changing the medium (triplicate washes with sulfur-depleted Tris acetate phosphate medium followed by centrifugation at 2,500 x g, 4 min, 20 °C), the cultures were adjusted to ~1.2 x 107 cells per ml (~27 µg of chlorophyll/ml) and supplemented with 1 mM glucose for optimal H2 production in Stm6Glc4. The gas-tight bioreactors were then illuminated with continuous light (300µmol x m^-2 x s^-1) for up to 120 h. H2 Measurement—H2 production was determined volumetrically, and the gas quality was measured via gas chromatography as described in a previous study. Chlorophyll Fluorescence Measurements—Chlorophyll a fluorescence yields were determined at room temperature (Mini- PAM, Walz, Germany). Photosynthetic quantum yield (Phi PSII) was determined by illuminating cell suspensions with actinic white light (300 µmol x m^-2 x s^-1, saturation pulse of 15,000 µmol x m^-2 x s^-1).

"Sample collection","The metabolic profiling of A. thaliana was obtained from experiments carried out in soil under greenhouse conditions, following a gradual step-wise salt acclimation approach [1]. Seeds of A. thaliana were directly sown in soil, “Einheits-Erde” type 0, using 10 cm pots. Plants were irrigated with half-strength Hoagland’s nutrient solution. Salt treatment was for 20 days and started four days post-imbibition. Four days after imbibition, germinated plants were transplanted to soil and irrigated with the above nutrient solution. Salt treatment started eight days post-imbibition and samples were taken after 24 days. The salt content of the nutrient solution was increased in steps, 10, 25, 50 and 75 NaCl mM. Time of each step was 4 days. A subset of plants was kept at each final salt level until harvest.

"Sample collection","Seeds of Lotus japonicus var. Gifu were germinated on agar plates containing agarified half-strength BD solution [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. Four days after imbibition, seedlings were transplanted to soil (Einheit, type null) in 10 cm pots, and irrigated with the above solution. Two salt-stress treatments were implemented: (i) gradual step acclimation to various final NaCl concentrations, or (ii) initial acclimation growth at various NaCl concentrations. The gradual acclimation started 8 days post-imbibition, and the salt concentration was increased in three steps of 4 days from 0 to 50, 100 and 150 mm NaCl. A subset of plants was kept at each salt level. Initial acclimation growth exposed plants from germination onwards to nutrient solution supplemented with 25, 50 and 75 mm NaCl. In both cases, fresh nutrient solution was prepared every 4 days. The total duration of greenhouse culture was 28 days under a 16/8 h day/night regime, 23 ± 2°C, 55–65% relative humidity. Whole shoots, excluding cotyledons, were sampled in situ into liquid nitrogen in the middle of the light period. Three successive independent experiments (experiments 1, 2 and 3) were performed during the spring season. Each experiment consisted of seven sample sets: control (no salts), 50, 100, 150 (gradual step acclimatization), ia25, ia50 and ia75 (initial acclimatization). Each set had seven independent biological replicate pools of four plants, with the exception of ia75 treatment in experiments 2 and 3 where fewer replicates were available (five and four, respectively). The stress doses used in the experimental designs were not lethal within the cultivation period, and at harvest all plants were in the vegetative stage, and roots did not show nodules.

Peaks were identified or annotated based on retention indices (RIs) and the reference mass spectra comparison to the Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) and our in-house spectral library.The amount of S-adenosyl-methionine was calculated by the sum of the mass numbers at m/z 188 and 236 using Leco ChromaTOF software version 2.32 (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) since this compound was not adequately detected by H-MCR.","MTBLS45"
"Derivatization","For methoximation, 20 μl of methoxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg/ml in pyridine) was added to the sample. After 30 h of derivatization at room temperature, the sample was trimethylsilylated for 1 h using 20 μl of MSTFA with 1% TMCS at 37 °C with shaking. Twenty μl of n-heptane was added following silylation. All the derivatization steps were performed in the vacuum glove box VSC-100 (Sanplatec, Japan) filled with 99.9995% (G3 grade) of dry nitrogen.","MTBLS45"
"Statistical analysis","Metabolomic data were log2 transformed and then statistically analyzed using the rank product method to identify differentially changed metabolites with the Bioconductor 'RankProd' package. Significantly changed metabolites showed a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. The FDR value in the rank product was obtained with 1,000 random permutations. PCA was performed with the Bioconductor 'pcaMethods' package. To reduce outlier-related artifacts, the Spearman rank correlation (r), which is relatively robust to outliers and is based only on monotonicity, was used for comparative metabolomic correlations. To identify differences between correlations, we tested whether two correlations manifested different strengths using Fisher Z-transformation. The local false-discovery rate (fdr) was determined with the 'fdragent' package. The significance level was set at fdr < 0.05. All statistical tests were performed with the R program http://www.r-project.org/.  To identify co-accumulated metabolite groups we used DPClus, a graph clustering algorithm that can extract densely connected nodes as a cluster. It is based on density- and periphery tracking of clusters. DPClus is freely available from http://kanaya.naist.jp/DPClus/. In this study, we used the overlapping-mode with the DPClus settings because we are confident that extracting clusters with the overlapping-mode is consistent with the overlapping of many of the metabolic pathways and protein complexes. We set the parameter settings of cluster property cp; density values were set to 0.5. To assess the statistical significance of clusters obtained by graph clustering, we subjected datasets of the aerial parts and roots of the 3 Arabidopsis genotypes and 100 randomly-generated sets of clusters to KEGG enrichment.","MTBLS45"
"Sample collection","The plasma samples for the NMR analysis were obtained from the backup aliquots of samples that, according to the SOPs, are stored in the Transfusion Service for analytical purposes for at least 24 h after blood withdrawal. The plasma samples were stored at −80 °C immediately after collection for further metabonomic analysis.","MTBLS46"
"NMR spectroscopy","Frozen plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and shaken before use. A total of 300 μL of a sodium phosphate buffer was added to 300 μL of each plasma sample, and 450 μL of this mixture was transferred into a 4.25 mm NMR tube (Bruker BioSpin) for analysis.","MTBLS46"
"NMR assay","Frozen plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and shaken before use. A total of 300 μL of a sodium phosphate buffer was added to 300 μL of each plasma sample, and 450 μL of this mixture was transferred into a 4.25 mm NMR tube (Bruker BioSpin) for analysis.","MTBLS46"
"Data transformation","Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential function equivalent to a 1.0 Hz line-broadening factor before applying Fourier transform. Transformed spectra were automatically corrected for phase and baseline distortions and calibrated (TMSP peak at 0.00 ppm) using TopSpin (Version 2.1, Bruker). Each 1-D spectrum in the range between 0.02 and 10.00 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift bins, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using AMIX software (Bruker BioSpin). Regions between 6.0 and 4.5 ppm containing residual water were removed. The total spectral area was calculated on the remaining bins and normalization was carried out on the data prior to statistical analysis. The projection of each 2-D J-RES spectrum was segmented and processed as described below for the 1-D spectra.","MTBLS46"
"Metabolite identification","All resonances of interest were then manually checked, and signals were assigned on template one-dimensional NMR profiles by using matching routines of AMIX 7.3.2 (Bruker BioSpin) in combination with the BBIOREFCODE (Version 2-0-0; Bruker BioSpin) reference database and published literature when available.","MTBLS46"

"Sample collection","As described in (Kusano, Fukushima, Arita et al., 2007), sterilized seeds were stratified at 5°C for 2 d, and were successively sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 1% sucrose. Plants were cultivated in controlled growth chambers at 22°C in 16-h light and 8-h dark conditions for 18 d. The aerial regions were harvested with 20 different biological replicates, 6 h after the onset of the bright phase. Among these harvested plants, the plants that had fresh weight over 13 mg were used for GC-TOF/MS analysis.","MTBLS47"
"Extraction","s described in (Kusano, Fukushima, Arita et al., 2007), each sample was extracted with a concentration of 25 mg fresh weight of tissues per µl extraction medium (methanol/chloroform/water [3:1:1 v/v/v]) containing 10 stable isotope reference compounds using a Retsch mixer mill MM310 at a frequency of 30 Hz for 3 min at 4°C. Each isotope was adjusted to a final concentration of 22.5 ng per µl injection. After centrifugation for 5 min at 15,100 x g, 400 µl of the supernatant was used for further analysis. The extracts were evaporated to dryness in a Savant SPD2010 SpeedVac Concentrator (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA).","MTBLS47"
"Chromatography","As described in (Kusano, Fukushima, Kobayashi et al., 2007), 1µl of each sample was injected in the splitless mode by an CTC CombiPAL autosampler (CTC analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland) into an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Wilmingston, USA) equipped with a 30 m x 0.25 mm inner diameter fused-silica capillary column with a chemically bound 0.25-µl film Rtx-5 Sil MS stationary phase (RESTEK, Bellefonte, USA) for metabolome analysis. Four replicates were subjected to 1D-GC-TOF/MS analysis. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The temperature program for metabolome analysis started with a 2-min isothermal step at 80 °C and this was followed by temperature ramping at 30 °C to a final temperature of 320 °C, which was maintained for 3.5 min.","MTBLS47"
"Mass spectrometry","As described in (Kusano, Fukushima, Kobayashi et al., 2007), data acquisition was performed on a Pegasus III TOF mass spectrometer (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) with an acquisition rate of 30 spectra/s in the mass range of a mass-to-charge ratio of m/z = 60-800. Alkane standard mixtures (C8–C20 and C21–C40) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Tokyo, Japan) and were used for calculating the retention index (RI). The normalized response for the calculation of the signal intensity of each metabolite from the mass-detector response was obtained by each selected ion current that was unique in each metabolite MS spectrum to normalize the peak response, using the method of Kopka et al. The normalized responses are peak areas corrected using the sample weight and a constant amount of the representative internal standard compound ([¹³C₄]-hexadecanoic acid).","MTBLS47"
"Data transformation","Nonprocessed MS data from GC-TOF/MS analysis were exported in NetCDF format to MATLAB 6.5 (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA), where all data-pretreatment procedures, such as smoothing, alignment, time-window setting, and H-MCR (Jonsson et al., 2004;2005), were carried out.","MTBLS47"

"Sample collection","Bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei brucei (s427) were cultured in vitro in either HMI11 (Gibco), CMM or modified media with 10% FCS Gold (PAA). Cell culture grade (or high purity) D-glucose, L-cysteine, L-glutamine and all other medium components were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 5 ml cultures were maintained in 25 ml vented flasks (Corning) at 37 ºC with 5% CO2. Cultures were grown to a maximum density of 4 × 106 cells/ml and sub-cultured by 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000 dilution, every 2 or 3 days, respectively. Cell counts were obtained by haemocytometer (Neubauer).","MTBLS49"
"Extraction","Metabolite extraction was performed according to previously described methods. 25 ml of cell culture was quenched by rapid cooling to 4 ºC in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 1250 x g for 10 minutes, and 5 µl spent media was removed and extracted by addition of 100 µl chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1). The remaining cell pellet was washed with 1 ml PBS, and the washed pellet (5 × 107 cells) was extracted with 100 µl chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1) by mixing for 1 h at 4 ºC, before centrifugation to remove precipitate. The resulting metabolite solution was stored at -80 ºC until analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Comparative data from HMI11 and CMM cell pellets and spent media are from 5 independent biological replicates.","MTBLS49"
"Chromatography","The LC separation was performed using hydrophilic interaction chromatography with a ZIC-HILIC 150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm column (Merck Sequant), operated by a Dionex UltiMate liquid chromatography system (Dionex, Camberley, Surrey), and coupled to a FAMOS autosampler. The LC mobile phase was a linear gradient from 80% B to 20% B over 30 min, followed by an 8 min wash with 5% B, and 8 min re-equilibration with 80% B, where solvent B is 0.08% formic acid in acetonitrile and solvent A is 0.1% formic acid in water. The flow rate was 300 µl/min, column temperature 20 °C, injection volume 10 µl, and samples were maintained at 4 °C.","MTBLS49"
"Mass spectrometry","The mass spectrometry was performed using an Orbitrap Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, U.K.) with a HESI 2 probe. The spectrometer was operated in polarity switching mode, with the following settings: resolution 50,000, AGC 1 × 106, m/z range 70–1400, sheath gas 40, auxiliary gas 20, sweep gas 1, probe temperature 275 °C, and capillary temperature 250 °C. For positive mode ionization: source voltage +4 kV, capillary voltage +50 V, tube voltage +70 V, skimmer voltage +20 V. For negative mode ionization: source voltage -3.5 kV, capillary voltage -50 V, tube voltage -70 V, skimmer voltage -20 V. Mass calibration was performed for each polarity immediately before each analysis batch, within 48 h for all samples. The calibration mass range was extended to cover small metabolites by inclusion of low-mass contaminants with the standard Thermo calmix masses (below m/z 1400), acetonitrile dimer for positive ion electrospray ionization (PIESI) mode (m/z 83.0604) and C3H5O3 for negative ion electrospray ionization (NIESI) mode (m/z 89.0244). To enhance calibration stability, lock-mass correction was also applied to each analytical run using these ubiquitous low-mass contaminants.","MTBLS49"

"Metabolite identification","Metabolite identification is based on accurate mass and predicted retention time, which is accepted as a level 3 standard of identification by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI), but should be considered as a putative identification. Retention time was verified by authentic standards for the major HMI11 components and other metabolites where possible.","MTBLS49"
"Sample collection","The Glc-tolerant strain of Synechocystis served as the wild type and was obtained from Prof. Murata (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan). The generation and characterization of the mutants ΔglcD, bearing a defect in the GlcD coding gene sll0404, and ΔgcvT, bearing a defect in gene sll0171 coding for the T-protein subunit of the Gly decarboxylase complex, have been described elsewhere [1][2]. For all experiments, axenic cultures of the cyanobacteria were grown photoautotrophically in batch cultures using 3 cm glass vessels with 5 mm glass tubes for aeration (bubbling flow rate was 5 ml/min) and 29 °C growth temperature under continuous illumination of 130 µmol photons s-1 m-2 (warm light, Osram L58 W32/3). For shift experiments, cells were precultivated with air enriched by 5% CO2 (HC) in BG11 medium [3], pH 7.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh BG11 at an optical density at 750 nm (OD750) of 0.8. After 1 h cultivation under HC conditions, Ci limitation was set by transferring those exponentially growing cultures to bubbling with ambient air containing 0.035% CO2 (LC). To prove PII protein phosphorylation, cells were shifted to HC and LC conditions in BG11 medium without combined N (replacing NaNO3 by equimolar amounts of NaCl) and nitrate-containing standard BG11, respectively. Growth was monitored by measurements of the OD750. Cultivation of mutants was performed at 50 µg/ml kanamycin or 20 µg/ml spectinomycin. Contamination by heterotrophic bacteria was checked by spreading 0.2 ml of culture on Luria-Bertani plates. All experiments were repeated using at least three independent cell cultures. </p>Ref: </br>[1] Hagemann M, Vinnemeier J, Oberpichler I, Boldt R, Bauwe H (2005) The glycine decarboxylase complex is not essential for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.

"Extraction","Samples of 5 to 10 ml cells, equivalent to about 109 cells/ml, were taken from the cultivation vessels and separated from the medium by filtration (0.45 µm nitrocellulose filters, Schleicher and Schuell) in the light without any subsequent washing. The cell pellets on the filters were put into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Time until metabolic inactivation by freezing was about 20 s. Thus, cells were separated from the bulk medium, but minor negligible contaminations of secreted metabolites may still have been present.</p>Metabolites were extracted from the deep frozen cells by a premixture of 300 µl methanol (final concentration approximately 80%), 30 µl nonadeconoic acid methylester (2 mg/ml chloroform), 30 µl of ribitol (0.2 mg/ml), and D4-2,3,3,3-Ala (1 mg/ml, standards in methanol). Each sample was mixed thoroughly at least 1 min for complete suspension, agitated 15 min at 70 °C, brought to room temperature mixed with 200 µl chloroform, and agitated again 5 min at 37 °C. Finally, phase separation was induced by 400 µl distilled water and the upper polar fraction retrieved by 5 min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm using an Eppendorf 5417 microcentrifuge.

"Chromatography","Samples were processed using a Factor Four VF-5ms capillary column of dimensions, 30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., and 0.25 µm film thickness with a 10 m EZ-guard pre-column (Varian Inc., Lake Forest, CA)) mounted to a Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent, Böblingen, Germany), which was operated in splitless injection mode.</p>Injection of a 1 µl sample is performed at 230 °C in splitless mode with helium carrier gas flow set to 0.6 ml/min. Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended.</p>The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 °C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 °C/min ramp to 350 °C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow.

"Metabolite identification","A complete matrix of peak heights representing arbitrary mass spectral ion currents of all available mass features was used for initial numerical analysis. Peak heights were corrected by the amount of cells using OD750 and to the recovered amount of the internal standard, ribitol, to yield normalized responses. These normalized responses were used to calculate response ratios, subsequently also called relative content, compared to the respective choice of control condition. Identification of metabolite-specific mass fragments from this data matrix was manually supervised. Compounds were identified using the TargetFinder plug-in of TagFinder-Software and a reference library of mass spectra and retention indices from the collection of the Golm Metabolome Database (http://csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/csbdb/gmd/home/gmd_sm.html; [1]). Thresholds for automated mass spectral prematching were match factor >650 and retention indices deviation <1.0%. Identifications were confirmed manually by co-chromatography of defined reference mixtures [2]. The full resulting data set of identified metabolites and respective normalized responses may be found within Supplemental Table S1. </p>Gln determination using the above GC-TOF-MS is impaired due to chemical conversion of Gln into pyroglutamate. Residual Gln can still be used for relative quantification but may be close to detection limits, while the use of pyroglutamate gives nonselective information on the sum of Gln and pyroglutamate and may contain trace contributions from Glu. For this reason, free amino acids were extracted from frozen cyanobacterial cell pellets with 80% ethanol at 65°C for 3 h. After centrifugation, the supernatants were dried by lyophilization and redissolved in 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, containing 2.5% tetrahydrofurane. Individual amino acids were assayed after derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde and analyzed by HPLC as previously described [3].</p>Data management, data transformation, and basic calculations were performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2003 options.

Apigenin (5 µl of 1 mg/ml solution in dimethylsulfoxide) were used as the internal standards in extracts prepared for the HPLC-MS and UPLC analyses.  Obtained extracts (200 µl) were  filtered through 0.45µm GHP Acrodisc 13 filter (Waters) and and subjected to HPLC-MS. Prior to the UPLC analysis extracts were diluted with 80% methanol (800 µl).","MTBLS52"
"Chromatography","UPLC-PDA analysis was performed using the Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography system with a photodiode - array detector (Waters, Milford, USA). The studies were carried out on BEH C18 column (2.1×150 mm, 1.7 micrometers particle size) (Waters) at 40 degree of Celsius with a mobile phase flow rate of 0.4 ml/min with water containing 0.1% formic acid v/v (solvent A) and acetonitrile (B).

"Data transformation","The chromatographic UPLC-UV data concerning all drought variants submitted for joint analysis were in the form of (retention time × wavelength × sample) table, with 10 801 retention times, 2 wavelengths, and 547 samples. They were processed using own scripts in the R system.a) Normalization: the raw data were normalized by mass of samples, which means that every single chromatogram value was divided by the mass of the appropriate extracted leaf sample. b) Baseline removal: chromatographic baselines need to be removed since they can negatively affect the alignment and ultimately the results of the data analysis. Therefore baselines were removed using the numerical differentiation without their explicit estimation.c) Retention time alignment: the correlation optimized warping (COW) was chosen for this purpose. This method operates on the entire chromatograms prior to the peak detection (see point d); it aligns profiles by matching their shapes and compressing or expanding time intervals, whereas the peak height and area are generally unaffected. d) Peak detection: peaks are here interpreted as the retention time intervals in which some kind of metabolite or a group of metabolites with similar chromatographic properties occurs. Peaks within individual chromatograms were detected using profiles of the second derivative; since the second derivative is usually characterized by a high noise, it was smoothed by a cubic smoothing spline.

Such defined peaks are not equivalent to chromatographic peaks present in different individual chromatograms as sometimes they cover several peaks (usually with small intensity).","MTBLS52"
"Metabolite identification","The individual compounds were identified by comparison of mass spectra and retention times to these of standard compounds and literature data.Several compounds were isolated from barley leaves on a preparative scale and purified using the flash chromatography on a polyamide column followed by preparative HPLC on reversed phase C18 column. Structures of the purified compounds were established using 1H, 13C, COSY, NOESY, HMBC, HSQC NMR spectra.","MTBLS52"
"Sample collection","Nine spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes were used in the experiment: European varieties Georgia, Maresi, Lubuski, Sebastian and Stratus, Morex - bred in USA, and Cam/B1/C1…/CL05761 (hereinafter referred to CamB1), Harmal and Maris Dingo/Deir Alla 106 (hereinafter referred to MDingo) being lines bred in Syria. Experiment was conducted in a greenhouse under partially controlled conditions. Plants grew in pots filled with loam-sandy soil. Four water regimes were applied: control (C) and three drought treatments in different developmental stages (S1, S2 and S3) as follows:C: 12% of soil moisture during all vegetation season;S1: first drought treatment: at the 3-lives stage, soil moisture in the pots was decreased to 6%, which was achieved within 48 hours, and maintained during 10 days; S2: second drought treatment: decreased soil moisture to 6 % started at the stage of the flag leaf and maintained during 14 days;S3: combined drought treatment: S1 and S2 variants of drought applied on the same plants. Leaf samples were harvested from the stressed and control plants in four replicates after 1, 3, 6 and 10 days of drought which is marked as I, II, III, IV moments of drought treatments for S1 and C respectively and V, VI, VII, VIII moments of drought treatments for S2, S3, C respectively. Harvested material was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until the metabolite extraction and instrumental analysis.","MTBLS52"
"Sample collection","Seeds of Lotus japonicus var. Gifu were germinated on agar plates containing agarified half-strength BD solution [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. Four days after imbibition, seedlings were transplanted to soil (Einheit, type null) in 10 cm pots, and irrigated with the above solution. Two salt-stress treatments were implemented: (i) gradual step acclimation to various final NaCl concentrations, or (ii) initial acclimation growth at various NaCl concentrations. The gradual acclimation started 8 days post-imbibition, and the salt concentration was increased in three steps of 4 days from 0 to 50, 100 and 150 mm NaCl. A subset of plants was kept at each salt level. Initial acclimation growth exposed plants from germination onwards to nutrient solution supplemented with 25, 50 and 75 mm NaCl. In both cases, fresh nutrient solution was prepared every 4 days. The total duration of greenhouse culture was 28 days under a 16/8 h day/night regime, 23 ± 2°C, 55–65% relative humidity. Whole shoots, excluding cotyledons, were sampled in situ into liquid nitrogen in the middle of the light period. Three successive independent experiments (experiments 1, 2 and 3) were performed during the spring season. Each experiment consisted of seven sample sets: control (no salts), 50, 100, 150 (gradual step acclimatization), ia25, ia50 and ia75 (initial acclimatization). Each set had seven independent biological replicate pools of four plants, with the exception of ia75 treatment in experiments 2 and 3 where fewer replicates were available (five and four, respectively). The stress doses used in the experimental designs were not lethal within the cultivation period, and at harvest all plants were in the vegetative stage, and roots did not show nodules. Growth was estimated by determination of mean fresh weight of the pooled shoots, and soil electrical conductivity was determined on 1:2 dried soil:water extraction.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Broughton, W.J. and Dilworth, M.J.

"Chromatography","A Waters Acquity UPLC coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to a Synapt HDMS QTOF MS (Waters, Manchester, UK) operating in W-mode and controlled by MassLynx 4.1 was used. The UPLC conditions were developed based in an in house previous published method (Arapitsas, Scholz, et al., 2012) and small changes were made in order to have a shorter chromatographic run and smaller back pressures. All samples were analysed on a reversed phase (RP) ACQUITY UPLC 1.8 µm 2.1 x 150 mm HSS T3 column (Waters) protected with an Acquity UPLC® BEH HSS T3 1.7 µm, 2.1 x 5 mm precolumn (Waters), at 40 °C and under a mobile phase flow rate of 0.28 ml/min. Water was used as weak eluting solvent (A) and methanol as strong elution solvent (B); formic acid 0.1% v/v was used as additive in both eluents.

"Mass spectrometry","A Waters Acquity UPLC coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to a Synapt HDMS QTOF MS (Waters, Manchester, UK) operating in W-mode and controlled by MassLynx 4.1 was used. Mass spectrometric data were collected by different runs in positive and negative ESI mode over a mass range of 50 to 2000 amu with scan duration of 0.3 s in centroid mode. The transfer collision energy and trap collision energy were set at 6 V and 4 V. The source parameters were set as follows: capillary 3 kV for positive scan and 2.5 kV for negative scan, sampling cone 25 V, extraction cone 3V, source temperature 150 ºC, desolvation temperature 500 ºC, desolvation gas flow 1000 l/h and nebulizer gas 50 l/h. External calibration of the instrument was performed at the beginning of each batch of analysis by direct infusion of a sodium formate solution (10% formic acid/0.1 M NaOH/Acetonitrile at a ratio of 1/1/8) by controlling the mass accuracy from 40 to 2000 m/z (less than 5 ppm) and mass resolution (over 14000 FWHM).

"Data transformation","For the quality control of the analysis and the number of features determination the raw data was converted to CDF (Waters Databridge) format and then processed using XCMS for feature extraction, grouping and alignment. For peak picking, the matched Filter algorithm was used with a peak width estimate of 20 s. The signal to noise parameter was set to S/N = 4. Data extraction parameters were selected on the basis of the characteristics of chromatographic and mass spectrometric performance. The Peak Table output of XCMS was used for the statistical analysis by the software EZInfo SIMCA-P version 12.0.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) under Pareto normalization. The PCA plots of EZInfo SIMCA-P were used for the quality control of the data sets by checking the distribution of the QC injections.

"Metabolite identification","Peak annotation was performed manually by comparing retention times and mass spectra (mass difference less than 10 ppm and two ions) to those of the standard, when available. Tentative identification of the chromatographic peaks, without a standard, was made by using spectral features (mass difference less than 10 ppm of theoretical value at least one indicative fragment and the isotopic pattern), and literature information about chromatographic properties and mass spectra records from external database like HMDB, Kegg and MassBank and an internal database for the wine metabolome based in bibliography.","MTBLS55"
"Sample collection","The UPLC-QTOF MS untargeted analyses were preformed within two months after the end of the experimental design and during this period wines were maintained at 4 °C so to block or slow down all possible reactions. Wines were uncorked under nitrogen atmosphere and an aliquot was transferred in a 15 ml amber vial (filled to its capacity). Then, always under nitrogen atmosphere, 3 quality control (QC) pool samples were prepared: (i) one pool sample by using 0.5 ml of each wine (QC), (ii) one pool sample by using 0.5 ml of each House conservation final point (24 months) wine (QCH) and, (iii) one pool sample by using 0.5 ml of each Cellar conservation final point (24 months) wine (QCC). For the dilution test, the QC sample was diluted 1:1 and 1:2 with Milli-Q water. Following the dilution experiment results, 1 ml of each wine was diluted with 1 ml Milli-Q water (1:1 dilution) and then 20 µl of the internal standard mix was added. Finally every sample/QC was filtrated with 0.2 µm PTFE filters into a 2 ml autosampler amber vial (MS certificated) prior the LC/MS analysis. The internal standard mix was 10 mg 3-indol proprionic acid and 17 mg 2,6-dihydroxy benzoic acid in 10 ml of MeOH:OH (1:1). For the blank the same procedure was followed but instead of wine 1 ml of Milli-Q water was used. The standard mix (STDMIX) was a mixture of trans-piceid (20 ppm), caffeic acid (50 ppm), catechin (5 ppm), malvidin 3-glucoside (5 ppm), quercetin 3-rutinoside (6 ppm), adenosine 2-monophosphate (45 ppm), malic acid (48 ppm), nicotinic acid (46 ppm), phenylalanine (42 ppm), and glucose (45 ppm) in MeOH:H2O (70:30).","MTBLS55"

Acetone (80%) was identified in the literature and empirically as a superior extraction solvent for sweet sorghum dermal and pith layers. Ethanol (80%) was used as a GRAS alternative. Fresh sweet sorghum sample (2 g) was extracted with 20 mL of extraction solvent chilled to −20 °C. This was to prevent excessive heating during the homogenization of the sample. This mixture was then homogenized for 2 min using an IKA T25 digital ultra TURRAX at 10 000 rpm. The tubes were then vortexed, and the resulting mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter (Tisch Scientific, North Bend, OH). The resulting pellet was then resuspended in 20 mL of extraction solvent by vortexing for 1 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and filtered. This was repeated for a third round of extraction, after which the filtrates were combined and the final volume was brought to 100 mL.

Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended.</p>The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 °C.

Retention indices of detected metaboliteswere calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEsmixture, followed by their chromatographic alignmentacross all analyses after deconvolution.","MTBLS71"
"Metabolite identification","Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors  during automated data-processing and toeliminate false identifications. The NIST 08 GC–MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained usingthe  Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites. The three most abundant fragment ions in the spectra of each identified metabolite were automatically determined byMetabolite D etector, and their summed abundances were integrated across the GC elution profile; fragment ions duet o trimethylsilylation (i.e. m/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance. A matrix of identified metabolites, unidentified metabolite features (characterized by mass spectra and retention indices and assigned as ‘unknown’), and their abundances was created for each Experiment for statistical analysis. Features resulting from GC column bleeding were removed from the data matrices prior to further data processing and analysis.","MTBLS71"
"Varying volume","To evaluate whether the effects of urease pre-treatment of urine varied with the volume of urine prepared, we compared the urine metabolite profiles from pooled urine after pre-treatment with urease (UT) and after no treatment (NT) using various volumes of urine. For this, several volumes (5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 µL) of the pooled urine sample were incubated (n = 3, each) with 100 µL of a 1 mg/mL solution of urease or were not subjected to any treatment. Metabolites were then extracted with concomitant protein precipitation by addition of 1 mL of cold (-20 C) methanol with vortexing for 30 s, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 15,000xg for 10 min at 4 C. The supernatants were transferred to glass autosampler vials and then dried in vacuo prior to chemical derivatization. If the extracts could not be immediately derivatized an d analyzed by GC–MS, then they were stored at -80C. Dried metabolite extracts were chemically derivatized using a modified version of the protocol used to create FiehnLib (Kind et al., 2009). Briefly, dried metabolite extracts were dried again to remove any residual water if they had been stored at -80°C. To protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric isomers, 20 µL of methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg/mL) were added to each sample, followed by vortexing for 30 s and incubation at 37°C with generous shaking (1000 rpm) for 90 min. At this point, the sample vials were inverted one time to capture any condensation of solvent at the cap surface, followed by a brief centrifugation at 1000×g for 1 min.  To derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms, 80 µL of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were then added to each vial, followed by vortexing for 10 s and incubation at 37°C with shaking (1000 rpm) for 30 min.

"M vs F compare","Finally, to evaluate whether any artifacts introduced by urease pre-treatment on the urinary metabolome interfered with the ability to distinguish between comparative samples, we compared the metabolite profiles from individual male and female urine samples after pre-treatment with urease or after no treatment (previous metabolomics studies of male and female urines (Pasikanti et al., 2008; Slupsky et al., 2007; Saude et al., 2007; Psihogios et al., 2008) have reported differences in metabolite levels). For this, 50 µL aliquots of individual male and female urine samples (n = 20, each) were blocked, randomized, and then incubated with 50 µL of a 1 mg/mL solution of urease (UT) or were not subjected to any treatment (NT), each as described above. Metabolites were then extracted with concomitant protein precipitation by addition of 1 mL of cold (-20 C) methanol with vortexing for 30 s, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 15,000xg for 10 min at 4 C.

"Constant volume","To initially evaluate the effects of urease pre-treatment on the urinary metabolome, we compared the urine metabolite profiles from pooled urine after pre-treatment with urease, water, or no treatment at all. For this, 100 uL aliquots of the pooled urine sample were incubated (n = 5, each) with 100 uL of a 1 mg/mL solution of urease (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number U4002) prepared in water (urease-treated; ‘UT’) or an equal volume of water alone (water-treated; ‘WT’) for 30 min at 37 C with mild shaking (500 rpm). Identical aliquots (n = 5) were not subjected to any treatment (no treatment; ‘NT’) and allowed to sit at room temperature for 30 min. Metabolites were then extracted with concomitant protein precipitation by addition of 1 mL of cold (-20 C) methanol with vortexing for 30 s, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 15,000xg for 10 min at 4 C.

For metabolite extraction, 25 µl of plasma sample was mixed with 175 µl of extraction buffer (25% acetonitrile in 40% methanol and 35% water) containing internal standards (debrisoquine, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, ceramide and lysophosphatidic acid). The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and dried under vacuum.

The gradient mobile phase comprised of water containing 0.1% formic acid solution (Solvent A), 100% acetonitrile (Solvent B) and 10% acetonitrile in isopropanol containing 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate (Solvent C). Each sample was resolved for 13 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 8 min and then 0.4 ml/min from 8 to 13 min. The UPLC gradient consisted of 98% A and 2% B for 0.5 min and then a ramp of curve 6 to 60% B and 40% A from 0.5 min to 4.0 min, followed by a ramp of curve 6 to 98% B and 2% A from 4.0 to 8.0 min, a ramp to 5% B and 95% C from 9.0 min to 10.0 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min and finally a ramp to 98% A and 2% B from 11.0 min to 13 min. The column eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer by electrospray ionization.","MTBLS72"
"Mass spectrometry","Mass spectrometry was performed on a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) instrument (Xevo G2 QTOF, Waters Corporation, USA) operating in either negative (ESI-) or positive (ESI+) electrospray ionization mode with a capillary voltage of 3,200 V in positive mode and 2,800 V in negative mode and a sampling cone voltage of 30 V in both modes. The desolvation gas flow was set to 750 l/h, and the temperature was set to 350 °C. The source temperature was set at 120 °C. Accurate mass was maintained by introduction of a lock-spray interface of leucine-enkephalin (556.2771 [M+H]+ or 554.2615 [M-H]-) at a concentration of 2 pg/µl in 50% aqueous acetonitrile. Data were acquired in centroid MS mode from 50 to 1,200 m/z mass range for TOF-MS scanning as single injection per sample, and the batch acquisition was repeated to check experimental reproducibility.","MTBLS72"
"Data transformation","Lipidomics: The data were preprocess using XCMS (Scripps Institute). The m/z features of metabolites were normalized with log transformation that stabilized the variance, followed by a quantile normalization to make the empirical distribution of intensities the same across samples. The metabolites were selected among all those known to be identifiable using a ROC regularized learning technique based on the LASSO penalty as implemented with the R package 'glmnet', which uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-wise fashion. We first obtained the regularization path over a grid of values for the tuning parameter, λ, through tenfold cross-validation. The optimal value of the tuning parameter lambda, which was obtained by the cross-validation procedure, was then used to fit the model. All the features with nonzero coefficients were retained for subsequent analysis. This technique is known to reduce overfitting and achieve similar prediction accuracy as the sparse supporting vector machine. The classification performance of the selected metabolites was assessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC). The ROC can be understood as a plot of the probability of classifying correctly the positive samples against the rate of incorrectly classifying true negative samples. So the AUC measure of an ROC plot is a measure of predictive accuracy. To maintain rigor of independent validation, the simple logistic model with the ten-metabolite panel was used, although a more refined model can yield greater AUC.","MTBLS72"
"Metabolite identification","Metabolite identification and annotation was done using metabosearch agent which integrates several databases and was developed by Habtom Ressom's group at GU.","MTBLS72"
"multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry","In this study, targeted metabolomic analysis of plasma samples was performed using the Biocrates Absolute-IDQ P180 (BIOCRATES, Life Science AG, Innsbruck, Austria). This validated targeted assay allows for simultaneous detection and quantification of metabolites in plasma samples (10 µl) in a high-throughput manner. The plasma samples were processed as per the instructions by the manufacturer and analyzed on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Xevo TQ-S, Waters Corporation, USA) operating in the MRM mode. The measurements were made in a 96-well format for a total of 148 samples, and seven calibration standards and three quality control samples were integrated in the kit. Briefly, the flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method was used to quantify a panel of 144 lipids simultaneously by multiple reaction monitoring. The other metabolites are resolved on the UPLC and quantified using scheduled MRMs. The kit facilitates quantitation of 21 amino acids, hexose, carnitine, 39 acylcarnitines, 15 sphingomyelins, 90 phosphatidylcholines and 19 biogenic amines. Data analysis was performed using the MetIQ software (Biocrates), and the statistical analyses included the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with follow-up Mann-Whitney U-tests for pairwise comparisons using the STAT pack module v3 (Biocrates). Significance was adjusted for multiple com- parisons using Bonferroni’s method (P < 0.025).","MTBLS72"

Probes were placed in ice to slowly warm up to ~0 °C. Then the probes were vortexed, sonicated for 15 min at 20 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 19000 /g. The supernatants were transferred to new 2 ml tubes and the remaining pellets subjected to a second extraction using 200 µl methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v). The combined extracts were evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge at 30 °C, reconstituted in 200 µl methanol/water, 30/70 (v/v), vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 19000 /g. The supernatants were transferred to glass vial for measurement.","MTBLS74"

"Sample collection","Enrichment cultures were generated by subdividing the mat lamina and streaking a subsample of the green layer onto BG-11 plates (Stanier et al.,1971) buffered with 10mM TES pH 8.0 and amended with 400mM MgSO4, 80mM Na2SO4, 20mM KCl, 1mM NaHCO3, here after referred to as Hot Lake autotroph (HLA) medium. HLA was amended with 1 x Wolfe's vitamins (Wolinetal., 1963) for initial isolation. Solid medium was generated through the addition of 10 g/L triple-washed agar (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Unless noted, all chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO. Plates were incubated at room temperature (~23 ˚C) under a fluorescent grow light (General Electric PL/AQ, Fairfield, CT) with a continuous photon flux of 20 µE/m^2/s. No exogenous sources of organic carbon were added. Two morphologically distinct cyanobacteria that grew on the plate were resuspended in HLA broth and physically isolated with a micropipette under a dissecting microscope. Each filament, including its co-isolated heterotrophs, was inoculated into sterile HLA broth and cultivated, yielding two unicyanobacterial consortia, UCC-A and UCC-O. The consortia were there after maintained continuously, with passaging performed every 4 weeks at a dilution of 1:100 into 100 mL of HLA broth in 250 mL borosilicate-glass Erlenmeyer flasks under the cultivation conditions described above.The enrichment cultures were physically homogenized prior to subculturing by dividing the cultures into sterile 50mL conical vials with sterile 3mm glass beads and vigorously shaking the tubes by hand for ~15 s to disrupt the biofilms. Heterotrophs were isolated from the Hot Lake mat or enrichment cultures by streaking a portion of a homogenized sample onto HLA plates supplemented with 0.25% yeast extract and 5m MNH4Cl, henceforth referred to as Hot Lake Heterotroph (HLH) medium, and incubating at room temperature in the dark. Single colonies were picked and streaked at least five times to obtain pure heterotroph cultures. Purity was verified by light microscopy and rrnA sequencing. Consortial biomass was harvested after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of cultivation and dried in vacuo.","MTBLS75"
"Extraction","All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. Dry biomass weight was recorded prior to resuspension with 200 µL of nanopure water to which was added a half volume of 0.1mm zirconium/silica beads (Biospec, Bartlesville,OK). The biomass was homogenized by vortexing for 2min, and metabolites were extracted with 800 µL of chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1,v/v). After centrifugation (15,000 x g, 4 degrees C, 5min) the aqueous layer was transferred to glass vials and dried in vacuo. Polar metabolites from microbial mat collect -80 degrees C  were extracted using the same procedure. A mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs; C8-C28) dissolved in hexane was used as a retention index standard.","MTBLS75"
"Chromatography","Polar metabolite analysis was performed with an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). For untargeted analysis of polar metabolites, dried aqueous layers were chemically derivatized as previously described (Kim et al., 2011, 2013) and analyzed in duplicate. Samples were analyzed according to the method used to create the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library (Kindetal., 2009). An HP-5MS column (30m x 0.25mm x 0.25µm; Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was used. The sample injection mode was splitless, and 1µL of each sample was injected. The injection port temperature was held at 250˚ C throughout the analysis. The GC oven was held at 60˚ C for 1 min after injection, and the temperature was then increased to 325˚ C by 10˚ C/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325˚ C (Kimetal.,2013). The helium gas flow rate was determined by the Agilent Retention Time Locking function based on analysis of deuterated myristic acid (Agilent Technologies) and was in the range of 0.45-0.5mL/min. Data were collected over the mass range 50-550m/z. The mixture of FAMEs(C8 - C28)was analyzed one per day alongside the samples to standardize retention index alignment in subsequent data analysis.","MTBLS75"
"Mass spectrometry","An Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used, and the samples were blocked and analyzed in random order for each experiment. Data were collected over the mass range 50-550 m/z. A mixture of FAMEs (C8-C28) was analyzed once per day together with the samples for retention index alignment purposes during subsequent data analysis.","MTBLS75"
"Data transformation","GC-MS raw data files from each Experiment were processed using the Metabolite Detector software, version 2.0.6 beta. Briefly, Agilent.D files were converted to netCDF format using Agilent Chemstation, followed by conversion to binary files using Metabolite Detector. Retention indices of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEs mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution.","MTBLS75"
"Metabolite identification","Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications. The NIST 08 GC-MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites. Fragment ions due to trimethylsilylation (i.e. m/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance.  Features resulting from GC column bleeding were removed from the data matrices prior to further data processing and analysis.","MTBLS75"

"NMR sample","Plasma was thawed at room temperature and 300µL was mixed with 100 µL of 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 150 µL H2O and 50 µL D2O. Precipitates were removed by centrifugation (12,000 x g) for 5 min, and 550 µL of the supernatant was transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes.","MTBLS77"
"NMR spectroscopy","1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV500 NMR spectrometer operating at a 1H frequency of 500.13 MHz and equipped with a 5 mm self-shielded z-gradient triple resonance probe and a B-ACS 60 sample changer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany).","MTBLS77"
"NMR assay","For each plasma sample two types of proton (1H) NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K. (i) 1D NOESY spectra were acquired with the noesypr1d pulse sequence (Bruker Biospin pulse program library). The water signal was suppressed by continuous wave irradiation during both the relaxation delay of 2.3 s and the mixing time (τm) of 100 ms. (ii) Water-suppressed Carr–Purcell–Meibom–Gill (CPMG) spectra were acquired with the cpmgpr1d pulse sequence (Bruker Biospin pulse program library). A fixed spin-spin relaxation delay 2 nτ of 60 ms duration (τ = 500 µs) was used to eliminate the broad signals from high molecular weight analytes, and water suppression irradiation was applied during the relaxation delay of 2.3 s. For both types of spectra, 256 transients were collected into 32,768 data points using a spectral width of 20.0 ppm. All spectra were processed using TOPSPIN version 2.1 (Bruker Biospin). The free induction delays (FIDs) were multiplied by an exponential window function corresponding to 0.3 Hz line broadening factor before Fourier transformation. The acquired spectra were manually phased and baseline corrected. The spectra of plasma samples were referenced to the anomeric proton of glucose (δ = 5.233 ppm).","MTBLS77"
"Data transformation","1H NMR spectra were automatically data-reduced to consecutive integral regions of equal width of 0.01 ppm (“buckets”), covering the range of δ = 9.0−0.5 ppm, using AMIX (Analysis of Mixtures software package, version 3.6.6, Bruker Biospin). The chemical shift regions at δ 6.00−5.60 ppm and δ 5.20−4.68 ppm were excluded from the plasma spectra to eliminate artifacts of the urea signal and of imperfect water suppression. The regions at δ 3.63−3.60 ppm, 3.23−3.20 ppm, 3.15−3.07 ppm, 2.70−2.68 ppm, and 2.58−2.53 ppm, which contained EDTA signals, were also excluded to avoid these signals affecting the multivariate statistical analysis. For each spectrum, the resulting integral regions were normalized to the total intensity of the spectrum to correct for inter-sample differences in dilution. Subsequently, the bucketed data matrices were imported into the SIMCA−P+12.0 software package (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden) for multivariate statistical analysis.","MTBLS77"
"Metabolite identification","The assignment of peaks to specific metabolites was based on the online databases Human Metabolome Database and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank. Assignments were confirmed by 2-dimensional (2D) 1H−1H double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF–COSY), 1H−1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), 1H−13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (13C−HSQC) and 1H−13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (13C−HMBC) spectra measured on selected samples.","MTBLS77"
"Sample collection","Fresh sheep (Ovis aries; n=10) and cow (Bos primigenius taurus; n=10) heart tissue was obtained from a local abattoir less than 4 miles away, packed on ice and driven back to the laboratory where it was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Portions of heart tissue were dissected and weighed (52 mg ± 2.6 mg) before storing at -80 °C until extraction. Since the purpose of the study was to assess the analytical reproducibility of a DIMS metabolomics study, no data was collected on the sex, breed or origin of the tissue supplied.","MTBLS79"
"Extraction","Low molecular weight metabolites were extracted from each cardiac tissue using a methanol / chloroform / water solvent system (final solvent ratio 2:2:1.8) as described previously [1]. Briefly, pre-weighed frozen tissue was homogenised in 8 ml/g of ice-cold methanol and 2.5 ml/g of ice-cold water in Precellys homogenisation tubes containing ceramic beads. The homogenate was transferred to 1.8 ml glass vials to which 8 ml/g chloroform and 4 ml/g water were added. Samples were vortexed and placed on ice for 10 mins before the biphasic mixture was centrifuged at 1800 g for 10 mins. After 5 mins at room temperature, ten 15 µl aliquots of the polar layer were transferred into ten 1.8 ml glass vials, dried in a centrifugal evaporator (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY) and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Further tissue from the same anatomical region of the same twenty hearts was extracted as one pool and then aliquoted in 100 µl aliquots to make ten identical QC samples.</p>Ref: </br>[1] Wu H, Southam AD, Hines A, Viant MR.

"Mass spectrometry","All biological and QC samples were reconstituted in 80:20 methanol / water containing 0.25% (by volume) formic acid. Samples were centrifuged at 15000-g at 4 °C for 10 mins to remove particulate matter. Metabolomic analyses were conducted in positive ion mode using a hybrid 7-T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (LTQ FT Ultra, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a chip-based direct infusion nanoelectrospray ion source (Triversa, Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY). Nanoelectrospray conditions comprised of a 200 nl/min flow rate, 0.3 psi backing pressure and +1.7 kV electrospray voltage controlled by ChipSoft software (version 8.1.0). Mass spectrometry conditions included an automatic gain control setting of 1 x 106 and a mass resolution of 100,000 (at 400 m/z). Analysis time was 2.25 minutes (per technical replicate), controlled using Xcalibur software (version 2.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Spectra were collected using the SIM stitching method, i.e. acquisition of seven overlapping selected ion monitoring (SIM) mass ranges between 70 and 590 Da in 100 Da windows, each with a 30 Da overlap with its neighbouring window [1]. This SIM stitching method has previously been shown to increase metabolome coverage compared to a traditional wide-scan approach, while providing high mass accuracy and a rapid sample throughput. For each replicate of each sample, data was collected as both proprietary-software-processed .RAW mass spectral files (Dataset 1: Instrument .RAW files) and as multiple individual transient files (i.e. signal intensity in the time domain).</p>Ref: </br>[1] Weber RJ, Southam AD, Sommer U, Viant MR.

"Mass Calibration and SIM-stitching","The individual files from the processing transients stage (Dataset 3:Frequency spectra) were further processed using a custom written Matlab code to peak pick and mass calibrate [1].  Peaks were selected based on using a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) threshold of 3.5:1, such that only peaks with a SNR value above this threshold were considered real, and retained in the dataset. Next, a calibration step was applied to convert the frequency domain to m/z values and finally the seven individual SIM windows per replicate were combined ""stitched"" into one file comprising frequency, intensity, resolution and SNR of each peak .  Three regions of electronic noise were removed (corresponding to m/z 74.00 to 74.05, 90.44 to 90.49, and 101.7 to 101.9) and a maximum peak distance of 1.5 ppm was used for alignment of peaks.</p>Ref: </br>[1] Southam AD, Payne TG, Cooper HJ, Arvanitis TN, Viant MR.

"Replicate Filtering","""Replicate filtering"" was applied to the output files from SIM-stitching (Dataset 5 Stitched peak lists).  Using custom written Matlab code, for each sample [1], the m/z lists for the triplicate replicates were filtered to a single 'combined' peak list according to this criteria: a peak must be present in at least two out of three replicates (for that sample) to be retained.

"Sample Filtering including TIC-filtering, Blank Filtering and Missing-value Filtering","""Blank filtering"" was applied to the output files from replicate filtering (Dataset 6 Replicate filtered peak lists).  This step consisted of using a custom written Matlab code to label and remove peaks from the biological samples that were also present in the blank samples; specifically, a threshold was set such that the peak was considered a contaminant if it had an intensity in the blank sample that was one-third or more of the intensity of the same peak in the biological samples.  This allowed for high intensity peaks of biological origin to be retained, even if there was a much lower intensity coincident contaminant peak. Next, 'sample filtering' was applied, which amalgamates the individual biological sample spectra into a data matrix according to this criteria: a peak must be present in at least 80% of the biological samples to be retained. A peak alignment maximum distance of 2.5 ppm was used here, i.e., only peaks with measured masses that were less than 2.5 ppm apart were considered to be the same peak.","MTBLS79"

"Batch Correction","A batch correction algorithm (Quality control-robust spline correction (QC-RSC)) was applied to Dataset 8a: SFPMPQN to reduce intra- and inter- batch variation. QC-RSC is written in Matlab (version R2011a, The MathWorks, Natick, MA) and requires the Statistics and Curve fitting agentboxes.","MTBLS79"
"Spectral Cleaning","Three ""spectral cleaning"" algorithms were applied to Dataset 8b: SFPMPQN+BATCH+KNN dataset (yielding Dataset 8c: SFPMPQN+BATCH+CLEAN) [1]. First, a peak was removed if the relative difference between the median QC sample intensity compared to the median biological sample intensity was inconsistent between batches. This phenomenon is indicative of a failure to detect that peak in the QC samples, within one or more batches (tested using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison of batch medians, after signal correction, with a critical p-value of 0.0001). As such the peak as a whole must be considered unreliable and removed. In the second spectral cleaning algorithm, a peak was removed if the difference between the median QC sample intensity and the median biological sample intensity was relatively large (tested using non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, with critical p-value set empirically to 1x10-14). This phenomenon indicates that the QC samples are not in fact representative of the average of the biological samples, perhaps due to degradation. Finally, a peak was removed if its RSDQC value was >20%; i.e. the analytical reproducibility of the peak was considered too high.</p>Ref: </br>[1] Kirwan JA, Broadhurst DI, Davidson RL, Viant MR.

"Averaging of transients","Transients are the recorded output measured by the mass spectrometer and contain information on the signal intensity for individual scans in the time domain.  For each analysis, custom written Matlab code [1] was used to collate and average the multiple individual transient files for each of the seven SIM windows and collate it with some important parameters for later processing.

"Sample collection","The diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain FY1679 were grown in fermenters, essentially as described before [1]. A set of chemostat cultures under C-, N-, P- and S-limiting conditions were established at a series of dilution rates (0.07, 0.10, 0.20 /h). Cultures were fed with a defined mineral medium limiting growth by carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulphur, all other nutritional requirements were in excess at a constant residual concentration. Glucose and vitamins were added to the medium after separate sterilization. Glucose was heat-sterilized at 120 °C. Vitamins were prepared and sterilized by filtration through 0.2 µm filters (Sartopore®2, Sartorius, UK). Chemostat cultivation was performed in 2-litre fermenters (FT Applikon Ltd., UK) with a working volume of 1.0 l, a temperature of 30 °C and a stirrer speed of 750 rpm. The culture pH was maintained at 5.0 by automatic addition of 2 M NaOH or HCl as required, via an Applikon ADI-1030 biocontroller. Aerobic cultivation was performed by maintaining an air flow of 1.0 l/min. The dissolved oxygen concentration in all chemostat cultures, as measured with an Ingold polarographic oxygen electrode, was above 50% of saturation. To avoid loss of volatile metabolites, the off-gas condenser was cooled to 4 °C, connected to a cryostat. Off-gas oxygen and carbon dioxide levels were monitored with a Tandem gas analyser (Magellan Instruments, UK). Steady state conditions were deemed established once biomass levels (absorbance and dry weight measurements), dissolved oxygen, and off-gas fractions remained constant over three residence times (three volume changes). For the rapamycin study, a batch culture growing at mid-exponential phase in minimal medium was established under the same cultivation conditions as for chemostat experiments. This was divided into two flasks. Rapamycin (200 ng/ml) was added to one half, and the vehicle added to the other, as the control. Samples were taken at 0, 1, 2 and 4 hrs after the treatment.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Baganz F1, Hayes A, Marren D, Gardner DC, Oliver SG.

Endometabolome samples (typically 1000 µl) were spiked with 4 µl internal standard solution (2.22 mg/ml [²H2]malonic acid, 1.92 mg/ml [²H5]glycine and 0.61 mg/ml [¹³C6]glucose dissolved in water) and lyophilized using a Speedvac concentrator vacuum system SPD111V connected to a Micromodulyo Freeze Dryer (ThermoLife Sciences, Basingstoke, UK). Exometabolome samples (200 µl) were spiked with 20 µl internal standard solution and lyophilized as previously described. Dried samples were derivatized as follows; 100 µl of 20 mg/ml O-methylhydroxylamine solution was added and heated at 40 °C for 90 minutes followed by addition of 100 µl N-acetyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide and heating at 40 °C for 120 mins. The final solution was spiked with 20 µl retention index solution (0.6 mg/ml n-decane, n-dodecane, n-pentadecane, n-nonadecane, n-docosane dissolved in hexane).</p>Chromatography was carried out on Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph using the manufacturer's software (ChromaTOF version 2.12) and a DB-50 GC column (Supelco, Gillingham, UK; 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm film thickness).","MTBLS8"
"Mass spectrometry","The sample was injected (1 µl) split ratio of 1 in 3 into a Agilent 6890 GC equipped with DB-50 GC column (injector temperature = 270 °C, helium carrier gas flow rate = 1 ml/min). The initial column temperature was 70 °C; this was held for 2 mins and then increased by 24 °C/min to 280 °C and hold for 5 mins. The column effluent was introduced into a LECO Pegasus III time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LECO, St Joseph, MI) with transfer line temperature = 250 °C, ion source temperature = 230 °C). The TOF mass spectrometer can collect spectra at up to 500 Hz and mass range of 30–500 m/z. In the ChromaTOF software the S/N threshold was set at 10, baseline offset at 1.0, data points for averaging at 7, and peak width at 2.5.","MTBLS8"
"Data transformation","In the ChromaTOF software the S/N threshold was set at 10, baseline offset at 1.0, data points for averaging at 7, and peak width at 2.5. Initial processing of raw data was undertaken using LECO ChromaTOF v2.12 software to construct a data matrix (metabolite peak versus sample number) using response ratios (peak area metabolite/peak area [²H2]malonic acid) to calculate the relative amount of each metabolite in each sample. For each metabolite peak for each set of three biological replicates, the CV was calculated as follows: %CV = (standard deviation/mean) × 100. The mean CV for replicate analytical analyses (n = 3) was 24.6% for all analyses undertaken, with 62% of these analyses having a CV less than 20% and 38.04% having one less than 10%. Although this shows precision to be less robust than for targeted analyses, this is appropriate in metabolic profiling, where many hundreds of metabolites are detected in short analysis times.","MTBLS8"
"Metabolite identification","Metabolite peaks were initially identified by searches on a commercially available mass spectral library [NIST/EPA/NIH (02)] (US National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institutes of Health; 2002) and libraries prepared by one of us (W.B.D.). For a peak to be identified required a similarity and reverse match score of greater than 700. Metabolite identification was confirmed by the analysis of pure chemical standards in identical conditions to the sample analysis. Identification was confirmed if the retention time (±5 secs) and mass spectra (similarity and reverse matches greater than 750) of metabolite peak in sample and standard were equivalent.","MTBLS8"
"Sample collection","Samples of hepatocytes isolated from individual mice were re-suspended in disruption buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF) and kept for 15 min on ice. The cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 800 psi for 10 min using nitrogen bomb and the resulting homogenate was transferred to a 50 ml Greiner-tube and centrifuged at 1000 x g (Beckman CS-6R rotor) for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant obtained was transferred to an SW41 ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF. The centrifugation was carried out at 100,000 x g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) for 1 h at 4 °C; lipid droplets (LD) floated in a white band at the top of the tube. Floating LD were collected into another SW41 tube and overlaid with the same buffer and centrifuged at same speed in the Beckman ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor) for 1 h at 4 °C, in order to avoid cytosol contamination. Re-floating LD were collected and used in all further experiments.","MTBLS81"
"Extraction","Samples were spiked with 40 nmol TG 17:0/17:0/17:0, 1.2 nmol PC 12:0/12:0, 2.4 nmol phosphatidyle- thanolamine (PE) 12:0/12:0, and 4 nmol phosphatidylserine (PS) 12:0/12:0 as internal standards and lipids were extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether. This ether extract was taken to dryness and the remainder solubilized in around 2 ml CHCl3/methanol 1:1 (v/v). For TG class determination 1:100, for all other class determinations 1:4 dilutions were prepared using the same solvent. For LC-MS/MS measurements, 200 µl aliquots were always taken from the dilutions and a solution mix of 45 LIPID MAPS internal standards (See manuscript supplementary Table I) was added, taken to dryness and resuspended in 200 µl solvent as above.","MTBLS81"
"Chromatography","5 µl of spiked samples were injected onto a Thermo 1.9 µm Hypersil C18, 100 x 1 mm, HPLC column mounted in an Accela HPLC instrument (Thermo Scientific). Solvent A was water with 1% ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid, solvent B was acetonitrile/2-propanol 5:2 (v/v) with 1% ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid. The gradient ran from 35% to 70% B in 4 min, then to 100% B in another 16 min, and was held there for further 10 min. The flow rate was 250 µl/min.","MTBLS81"
"Mass spectrometry","Data acquisition was performed by Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR-MS) (Linear Trap Quadrupole-Fourier Transform, LTQ-FT; Thermo Scientific) full scans at a resolution of 200,000 and <2 ppm mass accuracy with external calibration. Spray voltage was set to 5,000 V in positive mode and to -4,500 V in negative mode, capillary voltage to 35 V, and the tube lens was at 120 V. Capillary temperature was set to 250 °C. From the FT-ICR-MS preview scan, the four most-abundant m/z values were picked in data-dependent acquisition mode, fragmented in the linear ion trap, and ejected at nominal mass resolution. Normalized collision energy was set to 35%, repeat count was two, and exclusion duration was 60 s.","MTBLS81"
"Data transformation","Data were automatically processed by Lipid Data Analyzer. Data were transformed from raw data to mzXML and further transformed into Chrom files.","MTBLS81"
"Metabolite identification","The MS profiling of individual lipid classes relied on our on-line LC-MS/MS platform in combination with LDA [1][2]. This approach permitted quantitative analysis of TG, DG, PL, and SM species, characterized by their numbers of carbon atoms and numbers of double bonds in constituent acyl residues. PL species included those of PC, LPC, PI, PS, and PE classes. Taken together, a total of 204 different lipid species were identified in this study. Our experimental conduct [1] did not aim for phosphatidic acid (PA), cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester (CE) classes, due to methodological considerations and the properties of the biological sample (bulk amounts of TG). Within the detection limits of the method, ether lipids were found. In the following, we present data on TG, DG, and PL species in ‰ relative to total amount of respective lipid class to facilitate recognition of nutritional phenotypes at lipidomic levels.</p>Constituent FA of phosphatidylserine (PS), PE, PC, DG, and TG species were analyzed in positive MS/MS spectra by respective FA neutral losses. FA composition of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) and sphingomyelins (SMs) was obvious by elemental composition derived from high-resolution MS data and by lipid class-specific fragments (m/z 184). FA composition for phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular species was elucidated by their carboxylate anions in negative MS/MS spectra. The most-abundant FA fragment or neutral loss in an MS/MS spectrum was normalized to 100% (base peak). Fragments indicative for FA with less than 25% intensity of the base peak were termed minor FA fragments and all others were termed major FA fragments. For better manageability, particularly of isobaric species, possible combinations predominantly composed of major fragments were considered major molecular species, and possible combinations predominantly composed of minor fragments were considered minor molecular species.</p>Ref:</br>[1] Fauland A, Köfeler H, Trötzmüller M, Knopf A, Hartler J, Eberl A, Chitraju C, Lankmayr E, Spener F.

"Extraction","1 g of frozen homogenized grape was extracted with 2 ml of a mix of methanol, chloroform, and water, in a ratio of 2:2:1. After vortexing and shaking for 15 min, samples were centrifuged to help in phase separation. The chloroform fraction of 24 different grape varieties, of which about half were white and half red types, was collected and pooled. Two different pooled grape sets were prepared, each pool containing different grape varieties. For the first experimental set, “No TEA,” the pooled fraction was divided into 500 µl aliquots, dried using centrifugal evaporation at room temperature, and stored at -20 °C. For the second experimental set, “TEA,” 0.1% of triethylamine was added to the pooled fraction, which was then divided into aliquots and dried as before. The dry TEA samples were stored at -80 °C. In the experimental set with TEA as an internal standard, trans ß-Apo-8’-carotenal, was added to the pooled extract before aliquoting. Before injection, samples were resuspended in 50 µl of ethyl acetate, briefly vortexed, centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000g and transferred to dark vials.","MTBLS85"
"Chromatography","Chromatography was performed in a 1290 Agilent UPLC equipped with an RP C30 3-µm column (250 x 2.1 mm i.d.) coupled to a 20 x 4.6-mm C30 guard column (YMC Inc., Wilmington, NC, USA). A flow rate of 0.21 ml/min and an injection volume of 3 µl were adopted. The mobile phases consisted of methanol (A) and tert-methyl butyl ether (B), both containing 5% of a mixture of water/methanol (20/80 by volume) and 0.2% (w/v) ammonium acetate. The gradient elution consisted of 100% A isocratically for 6 min, a step to 82.5% A at 7 min, maintained isocratically for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 32.5% A by 30 min, these conditions were maintained for 14 min. A conditioning phase (48–60 min) was then used to return the column the initial concentration of A.  The DAD signal was acquired from 200 to 600 nm (step 1.2 nm) with a slit width of 1nm, at a frequency of 2.5 Hz.","MTBLS85"

"Analysis","Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) was performed using nonnegativity constraints in both the chromatographic and spectral dimensions. No unimodality or selectivity constraints were imposed. The MCR algorithm was started using initial guesses from orthogonal projection approach (OPA), using eight components for each individual time window. The number of eight components was chosen to be sufficient to cover all expected compounds plus a few unexpected ones. OPA was initialized with the spectra of those standards known to be eluting in the corresponding time windows, and the rest of the eight components were found by the OPA algorithm. Again, to ensure complete automation, no attempt was made at this stage to optimize the number of components. The MCR algorithm was allowed to run for at most 1,000 iterations. If the default convergence criterion was met, the run was terminated earlier. MCR models were then stored for visualization and further inspection. Postprocessing of the basic MCR models serves to simplify, validate, and improve the initial results. Two aspects in particular are addressed here. Firstly, one may check for the possible overestimation or underestimation of the number of components in the MCR analysis. Underestimation will result in high residuals and a bad description of the system. If so, additional components may be added until a correct description is obtained. Overestimation of components may be detected when two or more elution profiles of different MCR components show a very high correlation coefficient. If this happens, one may hypothesize that these components need to be combined.In the case of multimodal elution profiles, caused by compounds with similar or equal spectral characteristics, we use a simple peak-finding algorithm to identify all individual peaks in the elution profile and approximate the corresponding peak areas by fitting Gaussian profiles. The locations of the peaks are given by the peak maxima, and the peak widths are determined using the full widths at half maximum. Only peaks with a maximum intensity above a threshold of 20 units are considered. This threshold has been determined empirically and can be changed easily if visual inspection of the elution profiles indicates the need to do so.After building the final MCR models, they should be validated in terms of model fit. The resulting elution profiles and spectra can be interpreted. Spectra can be compared to spectra from a library or evaluated on the presence and absence of expected features. Elution profiles can be evaluated easily on the basis of peak shapes and intensities. Unequivocal identification can be done on the basis of spectral characteristics and retention times in cases where standards are available.MCR was used according to the functions in packages ALS (http://cran.r-project.org/package=ALS), data analysis was performed using R (http://www.r-project.org/).","MTBLS85"
"Sample collection","10 ± 0.1 g of Vitis Vinifera L cv. Sangiovese grapes (2009 harvest, Tuscany, Italy) were weighed from a representative sample (~1 kg) of healthy grapes at technological maturity and stored at -80°C after homogenisation under liquid nitrogen. Technological maturity was defined via measurements of total soluble solids (23.6° Brix) and titratable acidity (as tartaric acid, 4.7 g/l) in the Sangiovese grapes juice (Theodoridis et al. 2011).","MTBLS85"

"Sample collection","Sample preparation. A pooled sample was prepared from freeze dried leaves of 22 plants of cassava grown in vitro. The pooled sample was ground to a fine powder using a freezer mill (Specs Centriprep., Stanmore, UK) and stored at -20C until the time of extraction. Samples were extracted from homogenised powder (10 mg), adding 800 μL of methanol:water (50:50, v:v) and 800 μL of chloroform, vortexing briefly and subsequently mixing for one hour in a Stuart SB3 rotator at 40 rpm (Bibby Scientific Limited, Staffordshire, UK). The samples were then centrifuged for three minutes at 17000 g, and the chloroform phase was collected by carefully pipeting. The chloroform phase of 30 samples prepared in this way was collected in a single receptacle. The pooled extract was divided into 200 μL aliquots which were dried by centrifugal evaporation. Samples were stored dry at -20C prior to resuspending for chromatography.","MTBLS86"

"Normalization","First, feature intensities were transformed to the log2 base scale to approximate normal distribution. Second, potential sample outliers were identified by plotting the total intensity for each sample. Samples with extremes total intensities might indicate sample degradation or technical errors and these samples were excluded.  Third, an ANOVA-type normalization was used to take into account factors of unwanted variation. Specifically, we fitted a linear regression for association between each feature intensity and several factors of unwanted variability. We then used the residuals from the regression as new feature intensities. The factors of unwanted variability can be identified by studying the association between several technical variables and the first principal components. In TwinGene we adjusted for the square root of the sum of the squared differences between original retention time and corrected retention time, analysis date, storage time and unknown cluster effect.

"Extraction","Metabolites were extracted from each sample, using a two-step methanol/ water/chloroform protocol. In brief, 100 µl methanol (HPLC grade) and 40 µl water per copepod were added to each sample prior to homogenization using a Precellys-24 ceramic bead-based homogenizer (Stretton Scientific, UK). Thereafter, 50 µl water and 100 µl chloroform per copepod were added to each sample, which was vortexed and centrifuged (1800 rcf, 10 min, 4 ºC), yielding an upper (polar) and lower (non-polar) fraction for each sample. Each polar fraction was collected into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and the non-polar fraction into a 1.8 ml glass vial. Extraction blanks were also prepared using identical methods except that no biological material was added to the solvents. Two quality control samples were pooled from polar and nonpolar extracts, respectively. All polar samples were dried in a centrifugal concentrator (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY), the nonpolar samples under a stream of nitrogen gas. All samples were stored at -80 ºC prior to analysis.","MTBLS91"

The polar extracts designated for this ion mode were each taken up in 100 µl of 0.25 % formic acid in methanol / water 4:1. Samples were centrifuged (10 min, 22000 rcf, 4℃) to remove any particular matter. They were run in a controlled-randomized sequence different from the extraction sequence, in three technical replicates which followed each other immediately. QC samples were run in the beginning, the end, and equidistantly throughout the sequence. Data was acquired at nominal 1E5 resolution from m/z 70-590, in 7 wide SIM (selected ion monitoring) windows. Nonpolar (lipid) samples were taken up in the original volume of methanol / chloroform 3:1, containing 5 % ammonium acetate.

"Sample collection","The samples used in our study were obtained from the neoadjuvant GeparQuattro trial, which was a multicenter, prospective, randomized Phase III trial with 1,495 patients with locally advanced, operable tumors. The patients were randomized into three arms: 4× epirubicine, cyclophosphamide (EC) → docetaxel (D) vs. 4× EC → 4× D/capecitabine (C) vs. 4× EC → 4× D → 4× C (Fig. 1). In addition, all HER2-positive patients (according to local pathology) received trastuzumab. Eligibility criteria and details of the trial have been described previously. The protocol was reviewed by all responsible local ethics committees and informed consent was obtained from the patients. One of the secondary endpoints of the trial was the investigation of biomarkers capable of predicting therapy response. Tissue, blood and serum were collected at baseline (BL) as well as at the time of surgery (OP). In our study, we used two cohorts of nonfasting serum samples. The global lipidomic analysis was performed for the discovery cohort comprising 142 BL and 111 OP samples, and an additional cohort of 194 BL samples was used for the validation (Supporting Information Table 1). The blood samples were collected during several years, centrifuged immediately and stored at −20°C at the site for no longer than month.

"Sample collection","The Swedish Twin Registry is a population-based national register including over 194,000 Swedish twins born from 1886 to 2008. TwinGene is a longitudinal study nested within the Swedish Twin Register initiated to examine associations between genetic factors and cardiovascular disease in Swedish twins. Twins born before 1958 and who has participated in a telephone screening between 1998 and 2002 were re-contacted between April 2004 and December 2008. Health and medication data were collected from self-reported questionnaires, and a blood sampling kit was mailed to the subject who then contacted a local health care center for blood sampling and a health check-up. Contacts were allowed on Monday to Thursday mornings (not the day before a national holiday), to ensure that the sample would reach the KI Biobank in Stockholm the following day by over night mail. The participants were instructed to fast from 8 PM (20:00) the previous night. A total volume of 50 ml of blood was drawn from each individual by venipuncture. First, a tube containing Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was filled and inverted 5 times immediately. These plasma samples were used for DNA extraction. Second, three gel tubes were filled, inverted 5 times immediately, let stand for 30 minutes for coagulation in room temp, centrifuge for 10-15 minutes at 3800 rpm. Thus, the serum was tapped from the gel tubes to a collection tube and placed in a transport cylinder. These serum samples were used for storage and for the following metabolomics analysis. Serum Samples for biochemical analysis were collected in the same way.Tubes were sent to Karolinska University Laboratory by overnight post where they were frozen at -80 °C in liquid nitrogen until analysis.In total, 12,591 individuals (55% women) participated by donating blood to the study, and by answering questionnaires about life style and health.Metabolomics was performed in a subsample of TwinGene. Specifically, we utilized a case-cohort design by selecting all the incident cases of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, ischemic strokes and dementia up to 31st December 2010 and a sub-cohort (controls) of 1,643 individuals (43% women). The subcohort was stratified on median age and sex, and for each of the four strata, we randomly selected a number of participants proportional to the corresponding number of cases.

"Extraction","Serum samples were thawed and 100 microliters of serum was transferred to 400 microliters methanol in 96-well format to precipitate proteins. This 80% methanol solution was stored at -20 ºC overnight, and then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3800g in 4 ºC to pellet precipitated protein. The supernatant was aliquoted to three separate 96-well plates, sealed using a heat-seal foil, and stored at -20 ºC until analysis.  Plate analysis order was completely randomized for each set of injections, and plates were run in batches of two plates, reflecting the autosampler capacity. Within each set of two plates, the run order was again completely randomized to prevent injection order artifacts. Duplicate injections were performed for all samples, with the second set of injections performed upon completion of the first set of injections for all samples.","MTBLS93"

Injections were made in 100% A, which was held for 0.1 min, ramped to 40% B in 0.9 minutes, to 70% B over two minutes, and to 100% B over 8 minutes. The mobile phase was held at 100% B for 6 minutes, returned to starting conditions over 0.1 minutes, and allowed to re-equilibrate at for 5.9 minutes. Flow rate was constant at 140 microliters/min for the duration of the run. The column was held at 50 ºC, while samples were held at 10 ºC.","MTBLS93"
"Mass spectrometry","Column eluent was infused into a Waters Xevo G2 TOF MS fitted with an electrospray source.

"Sample collection"," A final inoculum of 1.6x10^8 CFU S. Typhimurium/mouse was delivered by oral gavage to 10 mice (two cages of five mice each = Salmonella-infected). An equal number of mock-infected animals (two cages of five mice each = control) were administered an equal volume of sterile saline. Our infecting dose (10^8 CFU/mouse) aimed to establish a persistent infection that would ensure observation of S. Typhimurium proteins in downstream analyses. On the day prior to infection, and at seven time points post-infection, mice from one cage were transferred to a clean cage and fecal samples produced at that time were collected, pooled, and immediately frozen at 280˚ C. Samples were collected on days -1, 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 21, and 28. Frozen fecal samples were thawed on ice, and starting material weight was measured. Samples ranged from four to 25 fecal pellets per pooled sample. After thawing, 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer was added to the sample (between 1-2.5 ml based upon starting weight; volumes were recorded and used for downstream normalization), which was subsequently vortexed to disrupt fecal pellets. The resulting slurry was filtered through a 70 mm sieve to separate and remove large debris (mostly undigested food particles). Filtrate was centrifuged (900xg for 10 min), and the protein-rich pellet thought to contain cellular material was retained as ""P1."" The supernatant was centrifuged to further clarify the sample (15,000xg for 10 min). The pellet was retained as ""P2"" and the supernatant retained as ""SN2."" Preliminary analyses demonstrated that P2 samples contained prohibitively small protein yields; therefore, P2 samples were not investigated further. Proteomic and 16s rDNA sequencing analyses were performed using P1, and metabolite and glycan analyses were performed using SN2. ","MTBLS96"
"Extraction","All chemicals and reagents used in metabolomics analyses were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), except for ammonium bicarbonate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and deuterated myristic acid (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Deionized and purified water was used to prepare buffer and standard solutions (Nanopure Infinity ultrapure water system, Barnstead, Newton, WA). SN2 samples (see Fecal sample preparation) were transferred to 0.6 ml microcentrifuge tubes, and water soluble metabolites were extracted with four volumes of chilled (-20˚ C) chloroform: methanol mixture (2:1). After separating the two phases via centrifugation (12,000xg, 5 min), the upper aqueous layers were transferred to glass vials and dried under a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). All extracted metabolites were subjected to chemical derivatization to enhance their stability and volatility during GC-MS analysis. Methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg/ml) was added to each dried sample, and incubated at 37˚C with shaking for 90 min to protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric peaks. N-methyl-N- (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was then added, followed by incubation at 37˚C with shaking for 30 min to transform hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms.
